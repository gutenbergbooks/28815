<h2>PUBLISHERS&#8217; NOTE</h2>
<hr class='mini' />
<p>Encouraged by the steady demand for Mr. Balch&#8217;s
&#8220;The Bridge of the Gods,&#8221; since its publication
twelve years ago, the publishers have decided to issue a
new edition beautified with drawings from the pencil of
Mr. L. Maynard Dixon. This tale of the Indians of the
far West has fairly earned its lasting popularity, not only
by the intense interest of the story, but by its faithful
delineations of Indian character.</p>
<p>In his boyhood Mr. Balch enjoyed exceptional opportunities
to inform himself regarding the character and
manners of the Indians: he visited them in their homes,
watched their industries, heard their legends, saw their
gambling games, listened to their conversation; he questioned
the Indians and the white pioneers, and he read
many books for information on Indian history, traditions,
and legends. By personal inquiry among old natives he
learned that the Bridge which suggested the title of his
romance was no fabric of the imagination, but was a great
natural bridge that in early days spanned the Columbia,
and later, according to tradition, was destroyed by an
earthquake.</p>
<p>Before his death the author had the satisfaction of
knowing that his work was stamped with the approval of
the press and the public; his satisfaction would have
been more complete could he have foreseen that that
approval would be so lasting.</p>

<h2>PREFACE.</h2>
<hr class='mini' />
<p>In attempting to present with romantic setting a
truthful and realistic picture of the powerful and
picturesque Indian tribes that inhabited the Oregon
country two centuries ago, the author could not be
indifferent to the many serious difficulties inseparable
from such an enterprise. Of the literary success with
which his work has been accomplished, he must of course
leave others to judge; but he may without immodesty
speak briefly of his preparation for his task, and of the
foundation of some of the facts and legends which form
the framework of his story. Indian life and character
have long been a favorite study with him, and in these
pages he has attempted to describe them, not from an
ideal standpoint, but as he knew them in his own boyhood
on the Upper Columbia. Many of the incidents
related in the story have come under his personal observation;
others have been told him by aged pioneers, or
gleaned from old books of Northwestern travel. The
every-day life of the Indians, their food, their dress, their
methods of making their mats, of building their houses,
of shaping their canoes, their gambling games, their religious
beliefs, their legends, their subjects of conversation,
the sports and pastimes of their children,&mdash;all these
have been studied at first hand, and with the advantages
of familiar and friendly intercourse with these people in
their own homes. By constant questioning, many facts
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_viii' name='page_viii'></a>viii</span>
have been gained regarding their ancestry, and the fragments
of history, tradition, and legend that have come
down from them. Indian antiquities have been studied
through every available source of information. All the
antiquarian collections in Oregon and California have
been consulted, old trading-posts visited, and old pioneers
and early missionaries conversed with. Nothing has been
discarded as trivial or insignificant that could aid in the
slightest degree in affording an insight into Indian character
and customs of a by-gone age.</p>
<p>As to the great Confederacy of the Wauna, it may
be said that Gray&#8217;s &#8220;History of Oregon&#8221; tells us of an
alliance of several tribes on the Upper Columbia for mutual
protection and defence; and students of Northwestern
history will recall the great confederacy that the
Yakima war-chief Kamyakin formed against the whites
in the war of 1856, when the Indian tribes were in revolt
from the British Possessions to the California line.
Signal-fires announcing war against the whites leaped
from hill to hill, flashing out in the night, till the line of
fire beginning at the wild Okanogan ended a thousand
miles south, on the foot-hills of Mount Shasta. Knowing
such a confederacy as this to be an historical fact, there
seems nothing improbable in that part of the legend
which tells us that in ancient times the Indian tribes
on either side of the Cascade Range united under the
great war-chief Multnomah against their hereditary foes
the Shoshones. Even this would not be so extensive a
confederacy as that which Kamyakin formed a hundred
and fifty years later.</p>
<p>It may be asked if there was ever a great natural bridge
over the Columbia,&mdash;a &#8220;Bridge of the Gods,&#8221; such as the
legend describes. The answer is emphatically, &#8220;Yes.&#8221;
Everywhere along the mid-Columbia the Indians tell of
a great bridge that once spanned the river where the
cascades now are, but where at that time the placid
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_ix' name='page_ix'></a>ix</span>
current flowed under an arch of stone; that this bridge
was <i>tomanowos</i>, built by the gods; that the Great Spirit
shook the earth, and the bridge crashed down into the
river, forming the present obstruction of the cascades.
All of the Columbian tribes tell this story, in different
versions and in different dialects, but all agreeing upon
its essential features as one of the great facts of their
past history.</p>
<p>&#8220;<i>Ancutta</i> (long time back),&#8221; say the Tumwater Indians,
&#8220;the salmon he no pass Tumwater falls. It too
much big leap. Snake Indian he no catch um fish
above falls. By and by great <i>tomanowos</i> bridge at
cascades he fall in, dam up water, make river higher all
way up to Tumwater; then salmon he get over. Then
Snake Indian all time catch um plenty.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;My father talk one time,&#8221; said an old Klickitat to a
pioneer at White Salmon, Washington; &#8220;long time ago
liddle boy, him in canoe, his mother paddle, paddle up
Columbia, then come to <i>tomanowos</i> bridge. Squaw paddle
canoe under; all dark under bridge. He look up, all
like one big roof, shut out sky, no see um sun. Indian
afraid, paddle quick, get past soon, no good. Liddle
boy no forget how bridge look.&#8221;</p>
<p>Local proof also is not wanting. In the fall, when the
freshets are over and the waters of the Columbia are
clear, one going out in a small boat just above the cascades
and looking down into the transparent depths can
see submerged forest trees beneath him, still standing
upright as they stood before the bridge fell in and the
river was raised above them. It is a strange, weird sight,
this forest beneath the river; the waters wash over the
broken tree-tops, fish swim among the leafless branches:
it is desolate, spectre-like, beyond all words. Scientific
men who have examined the field with a view to determining
the credibility of the legend about the bridge are
convinced that it is essentially true. Believed in by many
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_x' name='page_x'></a>x</span>
tribes, attested by the appearance of the locality, and
confirmed by geological investigation, it is surely entitled
to be received as a historic fact.</p>
<p>The shipwreck of an Oriental vessel on the Oregon
coast, which furnishes one of the most romantic elements
in our story, is an altogether probable historic incident, as
explained more fully in a foot-note on <a href="#page75">page 75.</a></p>
<p>The spelling of Indian names, in which authorities differ
so widely, has been made as accurate as possible; and,
as in the name &#8220;Wallulah,&#8221; the oldest and most Indian-like
form has been chosen. An exception has been made
in the case of the modernized and corrupted &#8220;Willamette,&#8221;
which is used instead of the original Indian name, &#8220;Wallamet.&#8221;
But the meaningless &#8220;Willamette&#8221; has unfortunately
passed into such general use that one is almost
compelled to accept it. Another verbal irregularity should
be noticed: Wauna, the name given by all the Indians in
the story to the Columbia, was only the Klickitat name for
it. The Indians had no general name for the Columbia,
but each tribe had a special name, if any, for it. Some
had no name for it at all. It was simply &#8220;the big water,&#8221;
&#8220;<i>the</i> river,&#8221; &#8220;the big salmon water.&#8221; What Wauna, the
Klickitat name, or Wemath, the Wasco name, signifies,
the author has been unable to learn, even from the Indians
who gave him the names. They do not know;
they say their fathers knew, but it is forgotten now.</p>
<p>A rich and splendid treasure of legend and lore has
passed away with the old pioneers and the Indians of the
earlier generation. All that may be found interesting
in this or any other book on the Indians, compared to
what has been lost, is like &#8220;a torn leaf from some old
romance.&#8221;</p>

<p>One Sabbath morning more than two hundred
years ago, the dawn broke clear and beautiful
over New England. It was one of those lovely
mornings that seem like a benediction, a smile of
God upon the earth, so calm are they, so full of unutterable
rest and quiet. Over the sea, with its endless
line of beach and promontory washed softly by
the ocean swells; over the towns of the coast,&mdash;Boston
and Salem,&mdash;already large, giving splendid promise
of the future; over the farms and hamlets of the
interior, and into the rude clearings where the outer
limits of civilization mingled with the primeval forest,
came a flood of light as the sun rose above the blue
line of eastern sea. And still beyond, across the
Alleghanies, into the depth of the wilderness, passed
the sweet, calm radiance, as if bearing a gleam of
gospel sunshine to the Indians of the forest.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_14' name='page_14'></a>14</span></div>
<p>Nowhere did the Sunday seem more peaceful
than in a sheltered valley in Massachusetts. Beautiful
indeed were the thrifty orchards, the rustic farmhouses,
the meadows where the charred stumps that
marked the last clearing were festooned with running
vines, the fields green with Indian corn, and around
all the sweep of hills dark with the ancient wood.
Even the grim unpainted meeting-house on the hill,
which was wont to look the very personification of
the rigid Calvinistic theology preached within it,
seemed a little less bare and forbidding on that
sweet June Sabbath.</p>
<p>As the hour for morning service drew near, the
drummer took his accustomed stand before the
church and began to thunder forth his summons,&mdash;a
summons not unfitting those stern Puritans whose
idea of religion was that of a life-long warfare against
the world, the flesh, and the devil.</p>
<p>Soon the people began to gather,&mdash;grave men and
women, dressed in the sober-colored garb of the day,
and little children, clad in their &#8220;Sunday best,&#8221; undergoing
the awful process of &#8220;going to meeting,&#8221; yet
some of them, at least, looking at the cool shadowed
wood as they passed, and thinking how pleasant it
would be to hunt berries or birds&#8217; nests in those
sylvan retreats instead of listening to a two hours&#8217;
sermon, under imminent danger of perdition if they
went to sleep,&mdash;for in such seductive guise did the
Evil One tempt the souls of these youthful Puritans.
Solemn of visage and garb were the groups, although
here and there the gleam of a bit of ribbon at the
throat of some young maiden, or a bonnet tastefully
adorned, showed that &#8220;the world, the flesh, and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_15' name='page_15'></a>15</span>
the devil&#8221; were not yet wholly subdued among
them.</p>
<p>As the audience filed through the open door, the
men and women divided, the former taking one side
of the house, the latter the other,&mdash;the aisle forming
a dividing line between them. The floor was uncarpeted,
the walls bare, the pulpit undraped, and
upon it the hour-glass stood beside the open Bible.
Anything more stiff and barren than the interior of
the meeting-house it would be difficult to find.</p>
<p>An unwonted stir breaks the silence and solemnity
of the waiting congregation, as an official party enters.
It is the Governor of the colony and his staff, who are
making a tour of the province, and have stopped over
Sunday in the little frontier settlement,&mdash;for although
the Governor is an august man, even he may not presume
to travel on the Sabbath in this land of the
Puritans. The new-comers are richly dressed. There
is something heavy, massive, and splendid in their
garb, especially in the Governor&#8217;s. He is a stately
military-looking man, and wears his ample vestments,
his embroidered gloves, his lace and ruffles, with a
magisterial air.</p>
<p>A rustle goes through the audience as the distinguished
visitors pass up the aisle to the front seats
assigned, as the custom was, to dignitaries. Young
people steal curious glances at them; children turn
around in their seats to stare, provoking divers shakes
of the head from their elders, and in one instance
the boxing of an ear, at which the culprit sets up a
smothered howl, is ignominiously shaken, and sits
swelling and choking with indignant grief during the
remainder of the service.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_16' name='page_16'></a>16</span></div>
<p>At length the drum ceased, indicating both the
arrival of the minister and the time for service to
begin.</p>
<p>The minister took his place in the pulpit. He was
a young man, of delicate mould, with a pale and intellectual
face. Exquisite sensitiveness was in the
large gray eyes, the white brow, the delicate lips, the
long slender fingers; yet will and energy and command
were in them all. His was that rare union of
extreme sensibility with strong resolution that has
given the world its religious leaders,&mdash;its Savonarolas
and Chrysostoms; men whose nerves shrank at a discord
in music, but when inspired by some grand
cause, were like steel to suffer and endure.</p>
<p>Something of this was in the minister&#8217;s aspect, as
he stood before the people that morning. His eyes
shone and dilated, and his slight figure gathered dignity
as his gaze met that of the assembly. There
was no organ, that instrument being deemed a device
of the Prince of Darkness to lead the hearts of the
unwary off to popery; but the opening hymn was
heartily sung. Then came the Scripture reading,&mdash;usually
a very monotonous performance on the part
of Puritan divines; but as given in the young minister&#8217;s
thoughtfully modulated voice, nothing could
have been more expressive. Every word had its
meaning, every metaphor was a picture; the whole
psalm seemed to breathe with life and power:
&#8220;Lord, thou hast been our dwelling-place in all
generations.&#8221;</p>
<p>Majestic, mournful, yet thrilling with deathless
hope, was the minister&#8217;s voice; and the people were
deeply moved. The prayer followed,&mdash;not the endless
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_17' name='page_17'></a>17</span>
monologue of the average Puritan clergyman, but
pointed, significant, full of meaning. Again his face
was lifted before them as he rose to announce the
text. It was paler now; the eyes were glowing and
luminous; the long, expressive fingers were tremulous
with excitement. It was evident to all that no common
subject was to be introduced, no common effort
to be made. Always composed, the audience grew
more quiet still. The very children felt the hush of
expectation, and gazed wonderingly at the minister.
Even that great man, the Governor, lost his air of
unbending grandeur, and leaned expectantly forward.</p>
<p>The subject was Paul&#8217;s vision of the man in Macedonia
crying for help. The speaker portrayed in burning
words the condition of Macedonia, the heathen
gloom and utter hopelessness of her people, the vision
that came to Paul, and his going to preach to them.
Then, passing to England under the Druids, he described
the dark paganism, the blood-stained altars,
the brutal priesthood of the age; and told of the cry
that went forth for light,&mdash;a cry that touched the
heart of the Roman Gregory into sending missionaries
to show them the better way.</p>
<p>Like some royal poem was the discourse, as it
showed how, through the storms and perils of more
than a thousand years, amid the persecution of popes,
the wars of barons, and the tyranny of kings, England
had kept the torch burning, till in these latter times
it had filled the world with light. Beautiful was the
tribute he paid to the more recent defenders of the
faith, and most intense the interest of the listeners;
for men sat there who had come over the seas because
of their loyalty to the faith,&mdash;old and grizzled
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_18' name='page_18'></a>18</span>
men, whose youth had known Cromwell and Charles
Stuart, and who had in more recent years fought for
&#8220;King Monmouth&#8221; and shared the dark fortunes of
Argyle.</p>
<p>The old Governor was roused like a veteran war-horse
at the sound of the trumpet; many faces were
flushed with martial ardor. The young minister
paused reflectively at the enthusiasm he had kindled.
A sorrowful smile flitted around his lips, though the
glow of inspiration was still burning in his eyes.
Would they be as enthusiastic when he made the application
of his discourse?</p>
<p>And yet England, yea, even New England, was
false, disloyal. She had but half kept the faith.
When the cry of pagan England had gone forth for
light, it had been heard; the light had been given.
But now in her day of illumination, when the Macedonian
cry came to her, she closed her ears and listened
not. On her skirts was the blood of the souls
of men; and at the last day the wail of the heathen
as they went down into the gulf of flame would bear
witness against her.</p>
<p>Grave and impassioned, with an undertone of warning
and sorrow, rang the voice of the minister, and
the hearts of the people were shaken as though a
prophet were speaking.</p>
<p>&#8220;Out from the forests around us come the cry of
heathen folk, and ye will not listen. Ye have the
light, and they perish in darkness and go down to
the pit. Generation after generation has grown up
here in forest and mountain, and has lived and died
without God and without hope. Generation has followed
generation, stumbling blindly downward to the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_19' name='page_19'></a>19</span>
dust like the brutes that perish. And now their children,
bound in iron and sitting under the shadow of
death, reach out their hands from the wilderness with
a blind cry to you for help. Will ye hear?&#8221;</p>
<p>He lifted his hands to them as he spoke; there
was infinite pathos in his voice; for a moment it
seemed as if all the wild people of the wilderness
were pleading through him for light. Tears were in
many eyes; yet in spite of the wonderful power of
his oratory, there were faces that grew stern as he
spoke,&mdash;for only a few years had passed since the
Pequod war, and the feeling against the Indians was
bitter. The Governor now sat erect and indignant.</p>
<p>Strong and vehement was the minister&#8217;s plea for
missionaries to be sent to the Indians; fearlessly
was the colonial government arraigned for its deficiencies
in this regard; and the sands in the hour-glass
were almost run out when the sermon was concluded
and the minister sank flushed and exhausted
into his seat.</p>
<p>The closing psalm was sung, and the audience was
dismissed. Slow and lingering were the words of the
benediction, as if the preacher were conscious of defeat
and longed to plead still further with his people.
Then the gathering broke up, the congregation
filing out with the same solemnity that had marked
the entrance. But when the open air was reached,
the pent-up excitement burst forth in a general murmur
of comment.</p>
<p>&#8220;A good man,&#8221; remarked the Governor to his
staff, &#8220;but young, quite young.&#8221; And they smiled
approvingly at the grim irony of the tone.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our pastor is a fine speaker,&#8221; said another, &#8220;but
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_20' name='page_20'></a>20</span>
why will he bring such unpleasant things into the pulpit?
A good doctrinal sermon, now, would have
strengthened our faith and edified us all.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ay, a sermon on the errors of Episcopacy, for
instance.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Such talk makes me angry,&#8221; growled a third.
&#8220;Missionaries for the Indians! when the bones of
the good folk they have killed are yet bleaching amid
the ashes of their cabins! Missionaries for those red
demons! an&#8217; had it been powder and shot for them
it had been a righteous sermon.&#8221;</p>
<p>So the murmur of disapprobation went on among
those slowly dispersing groups who dreaded and hated
the Indian with an intensity such as we now can hardly
realize. And among them came the minister, pale
and downcast, realizing that he had dashed himself
in vain against the stern prejudice of his people and
his age.</p>

<p>The Reverend Cecil Grey,&mdash;for such was our
young minister&#8217;s name,&mdash;proceeded immediately
after the service to his home. Before we cross
its threshold with him, let us pause for a moment to
look back over his past life.</p>
<p>Born in New England, he first received from his
father, who was a fine scholar, a careful home training,
and was then sent to England to complete his
education. At Magdalen College, Oxford, he spent
six years. Time passed very happily with him in the
quiet cloisters of that most beautiful of English colleges,
with its memories of Pole and Rupert, and the
more courtly traditions of the state that Richard and
Edward had held there. But when, in 1687, James
II. attempted to trample on the privileges of the Fellows
and force upon them a popish president, Cecil
was one of those who made the famous protest against
it; and when protests availed nothing, he left Oxford,
as also did a number of others. Returning to America,
he was appointed pastor of a New England
church, becoming one of the many who carried the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_22' name='page_22'></a>22</span>
flower of scholarship and eloquence into the bleak
wilds of the New World.</p>
<p>Restless, sensitive, ardent, he was a man to whom
a settled pastorate was impossible. Daring enterprises,
great undertakings of a religious nature yet full
of peril, were the things for which he was naturally
fitted; and amid the monotonous routine of parish
duties he longed for a greater activity. Two centuries
later he might have become distinguished as a revivalist
or as a champion of new and startling views of
theology; earlier, he might have been a reformer, a
follower of Luther or Loyola; as it was, he was out
of his sphere.</p>
<p>But for a time the Reverend Mr. Grey tried hard
to mould himself to his new work. He went with
anxious fidelity through all the labors of the country
pastorate. He visited and prayed with the sick, he
read the Bible to the old and dim-sighted, he tried to
reconcile petty quarrels, he wrestled with his own
discontent, and strove hard to grind down all the
aspirations of his nature and shut out the larger
horizon of life.</p>
<p>And for a time he was successful; but during it he
was induced to take a very fatal step. He was young,
handsome, a clergyman, and unmarried. Now a
young unmarried minister is pre-eminently one of
sorrows and acquainted with grief. For that large
body of well-meaning people who are by nature incapacitated
from attending to their own business take
him in hand without mercy. Innumerable are the
ways in which he is informed that he ought to be married.
Subtle and past finding out are the plots laid by
all the old ladies and match-makers of his church to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_23' name='page_23'></a>23</span>
promote that desired event. He is told that he can
never succeed in the ministry till he is married. The
praises of Matilda Jane Tompkins or Lucinda Brown
are sounded in his ears till he almost wishes that
both were in a better world,&mdash;a world more worthy
their virtues. At length, wearily capitulating, he
marries some wooden-faced or angular saint, and is
unhappy for life.</p>
<p>Now there was in Mr. Grey&#8217;s church a good, gentle
girl, narrow but not wooden-faced, famous for her
neatness and her housekeeping abilities, who was
supposed to be the pattern for a minister&#8217;s wife. In
time gone by she had set her heart on a graceless
sailor lad who was drowned at sea, much to the relief
of her parents. Ruth Anderson had mourned for him
quietly, shutting up her sorrow in her own breast and
going about her work as before; for hers was one of
those subdued, practical natures that seek relief from
trouble in hard work.</p>
<p>She seemed in the judgment of all the old women
in the church the &#8220;very one&#8221; for Mr. Grey; and it
likewise seemed that Mr. Grey was the &#8220;very one&#8221; for
her. So divers hints were dropped and divers things
were said, until each began to wonder if marriage
were not a duty. The Reverend Cecil Grey began
to take unusual pains with his toilet, and wended his
way up the hill to Mr. Anderson&#8217;s with very much the
aspect of a man who is going to be hanged. And his
attempts at conversation with the maiden were not at
all what might have been expected from the young
minister whose graceful presence and fluent eloquence
had been the boast of Magdalen. On her part the
embarrassment was equally great. At length they
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_24' name='page_24'></a>24</span>
were married,&mdash;a marriage based on a false idea of
duty on each side. But no idea of duty, however
strong or however false, could blind the eyes of this
married pair to the terrible fact that not only love but
mental sympathy was wanting. Day by day Cecil
felt that his wife did not love him, that her thoughts
were not for him, that it was an effort for her to act
the part of a wife toward him. Day by day she felt
that his interests lay beyond her reach, and that all
the tenderness in his manner toward her came from
a sense of duty, not from love.</p>
<p>But she strove in all ways to be a faithful wife, and
he tried hard to be a kind and devoted husband.
He had been especially attentive to her of late, for
her health had been failing, and the old doctor had
shaken his head very gravely over her. For a week
or more she had grown steadily worse, and was now
unable even to walk without help. Her malady was
one of those that sap away the life with a swift and
deadly power against which all human skill seems
unavailing.</p>
<p>Mr. Grey on returning from church entered the
living room. The invalid sat at the window, a heavy
shawl wrapped about her, her pale face turned to the
far blue line of sea, visible through a gap in the hills.
A pang wrenched his heart keenly at the sight. Why
<i>would</i> she always sit at that window looking so sorrowfully,
so abstractedly at the sea, as if her heart
was buried there with her dead lover?</p>
<p>She started as she heard his footstep, and turned
her head quickly toward him, a faint flush tinging her
cheek and a forced smile quivering around her lips.
Her greeting was very gentle, and he saw that her
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_25' name='page_25'></a>25</span>
heart was reproaching her for being so disloyal to
him as to think of her lost lover; and yet he felt
her fingers tremble and shrink away from his as he
took her hand.</p>
<p>&#8220;God forgive me!&#8221; he thought, with infinite self-accusation.
&#8220;How repugnant I must be to her,&mdash;an
intruder, thrusting myself into the heart that is
sacred to the dead.&#8221;</p>
<p>But he let her see nothing of this in his voice or
manner as he inquired how she had been. She replied
wearily that she was no better, that she longed
to get well again and be at work.</p>
<p>&#8220;I missed your sermon to-day,&#8221; she said, with that
strained, pathetic smile upon her lips again. &#8220;You
must tell me about it now.&#8221;</p>
<p>He drew his chair to her side and began to give
an outline of the sermon. She listened, but it was
with forced attention, without sympathy, without in
the least entering into the spirit of what he was saying.
It pained him. He knew that her nature was
so narrow, so conventional, that it was impossible
for her to comprehend his grand scheme of Indian
evangelization. But he checked his impatience, and
gave her a full synopsis of the discourse.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is useless, useless. They cannot understand.
A whole race is perishing around them, and they will
not put forth a hand save to mistreat a Quaker or
throw a stone at a Churchman. Our Puritanism is
like iron to resist tyranny,&mdash;but alas! it is like iron,
too, when one tries to bend it to some generous
undertaking.&#8221;</p>
<p>He stopped, checking back other and more bitter
words. All his soul rose up in revolt against the prejudice
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_26' name='page_26'></a>26</span>
by which he was surrounded. Then Ruth
spoke timidly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Seeing that it is so, would it not be best to let
this missionary subject go, and preach on practical
every-day matters? I am not wise in these things, I
know; but would it not be better to preach on common
subjects, showing us how we ought to live from
day to day, than to discourse of those larger things
that the people do not understand?&#8221;</p>
<p>His face darkened, though not angrily. This was
the same prejudice he had just encountered in the
meeting-house, though in a different form. He arose
and paced back and forth with quick, impatient steps.
Then he came and stood before her with folded arms
and resolute face.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ruth, I have tried that so often, tried it with prayers
and tears, but it is utterly impossible. I cannot
bring myself to it. You know what the physicians
say of my disease of the heart,&mdash;that my life may be
very short; and I want it to be noble. I want to
live for the greatest possibilities within my reach. I
want to set some great work in motion that will
light up thousands of darkened lives,&mdash;yea, and
grow in might and power even after my lips are sealed
in death.&#8221;</p>
<p>The little figure on the chair moved uneasily under
his animated though kindly gaze.</p>
<p>&#8220;I do not quite comprehend you. I think the best
work is to do what God gives us to do, and to do it well.
To me he has given to labor in caring for the house,&#8221;&mdash;there
was a patient weariness in her tone that did
not escape Cecil,&mdash;&#8220;to you he has given the duties
of a pastor, to strengthen the weak, cheer the sorrowing,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_27' name='page_27'></a>27</span>
comfort the old. Is it not better to do those
things faithfully than to spend our time longing for
some more ideal work not given us?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But suppose the ideal work is given? Suppose
a man is called to proclaim new truths, and be the
leader in a new reform? For him the quiet pastorate
is impossible; nay, were it possible, it would be
wrong, for would he not be keeping back the message
God had given him? He would be one called
to a work, yet entering not upon it; and upon him
would come the curse that fell on the unfaithful
prophets of old.&#8221;</p>
<p>All the gloom of the theology of his age was on
him as he spoke. Refined and poetic as was his
nature, it was thoroughly imbued with the Calvinism
of early New England.</p>
<p>She lifted her hand wearily and passed it over her
aching brow.</p>
<p>&#8220;I do not know,&#8221; she said; &#8220;I have never thought
of such things, only it seems to me that God knew
best when he gave us our lots in life. Surely wherever
we find ourselves, there he intended us to be,
and there we should patiently work, leaving our
higher aspirations to his will. Is not the ideal life,
after all, the one that is kindest and humblest?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But, Ruth,&#8221; replied the minister, sadly, &#8220;while
the work you describe is certainly noble, I have yet
felt for a long time that it is not what God calls me
to. Day after day, night after night, I think of the
wild races that roam the forests to the west, of which
no man knows the end. Sometimes I think that I
am called to stand before the rulers of the colony
and plead that missionaries be sent to the Indians.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_28' name='page_28'></a>28</span>
Sometimes I feel that I am called to go and preach
to them myself. Often in my dreams I plead with
dark-browed sachems or with mighty gatherings of
warriors to cast away their blood-stained weapons
and accept Christ, till I awake all trembling with the
effort. And always the deadly pain at my heart
warns me that what is done must be done quickly.&#8221;</p>
<p>The burning ardor that had given such intensity to
his sermon came into his voice as he spoke. The invalid
moved nervously on her chair, and he saw that
his enthusiasm merely jarred on her without awakening
any response.</p>
<p>&#8220;Forgive me,&#8221; he said hurriedly, &#8220;I forgot that
you were not well enough to talk of those things.
Sometime when you are better we will speak of them
again.&#8221;</p>
<p>And then he talked of other and to her more interesting
topics, while a keen pang rankled in his
breast to find her irresponsive to that which was so
dear to him.</p>
<p>But he was very kind to her; and when after a
while the old Indian woman, Cecil&#8217;s nurse in childhood
and their only servant now, came to tell him
that dinner was ready, he would not go until he had
first brought his wife her dinner and waited on her
with his own hands.</p>
<p>After his own repast was finished he must hasten
away to preach his afternoon sermon. But he came
to her first and bent over her; for though love never
had been, perhaps never could be, between them, there
was a deep domestic feeling in his nature.</p>
<p>&#8220;How good and patient you are in your sickness,&#8221;
he said, gazing down into the quiet, wistful face that
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_29' name='page_29'></a>29</span>
was so honest and true, yet so thoroughly prosaic and
commonplace. &#8220;What a sermon you have been
preaching me, sitting here so uncomplainingly.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you think so?&#8221; she said, looking up gratefully.
&#8220;I am glad. I so want to do my duty by
you.&#8221;</p>
<p>He had meant to kiss her as he bent over her,
though such caresses were rare between them, but
there was something in her tones that chilled him,
and he merely raised a tress of her hair to his lips
instead. At the door he bade her a pleasant farewell,
but his countenance grew sorrowful as he went down
the path.</p>
<p>&#8220;Duty,&#8221; he murmured, &#8220;always duty, never love.
Well, the fault is my own that we were ever married.
God help me to be true and kind to her always. She
shall never know that I miss anything in her.&#8221;</p>
<p>And he preached to his congregation that afternoon
a sermon on burden-bearing, showing how each
should bear his own burden patiently,&mdash;not darkening
the lives of others by complaint, but always saying
loving words, no matter how much of heartache lay
beneath them. He told how near God is to us all,
ready to heal and to strengthen; and closed by showing
how sweet and beautiful even a common life may
grow through brave and self-sacrificing endurance of
trouble.</p>
<p>It was a helpful sermon, a sermon that brought
the listeners nearer God. More than one heart was
touched by those earnest words that seemed to breathe
divine sympathy and compassion.</p>
<p>He went home feeling more at peace than he had
done for many days. His wife&#8217;s room was still, as he
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_30' name='page_30'></a>30</span>
entered it. She was in her easy-chair at the window,
lying back among the pillows asleep. Her face was
flushed and feverish, her long lashes wet with tears.
The wraps had fallen away from her, and he stooped
over to replace them. As he did so her lips moved
in her half-delirious slumber, and she murmured some
name sounding like his own. A wild throb of joy
thrilled through him, and he bent closer to listen.
Again she spoke the name, spoke it sorrowfully, longingly.
It was the name of her lover drowned at sea.</p>
<p>The long, nervous fingers that held the half-drawn
wraps shook convulsively as with acutest pain, then
drew the coverings gently around her.</p>
<p>&#8220;God help her, God help her!&#8221; he murmured, as
he turned softly away, his eyes filling with tears,&mdash;tears
for her sorrow rather than his own.</p>

<p>Ruth was much worse in the evening, but at
last, after Cecil had watched at her side till a
late hour, she sank into a troubled sleep. Then the
old Indian servant insisted on taking his place at the
sufferer&#8217;s bedside, for she saw that he was much worn
by the labors of the day and by anxiety for his wife.
At first he refused; but she was a skilled nurse, and
he knew that the invalid would fare better in her
hands than his own, so at last he consented on condition
that she would call him if his wife grew worse.
The woman promised, and he withdrew into the
library, where a temporary bed had been made for
him. At the door he turned and looked back.</p>
<p>His wife lay with closed eyes and flushed face amid
the white pillows. The robe over her breast stirred
with her difficult breathing, and her head turned now
and then from side to side while she uttered broken,
feverish words. By her sat the swarthy nurse, watching
her every movement and ready with observant
eye and gentle touch to minister to all her needs.</p>
<p>A yearning tenderness and pity came into his gaze.
&#8220;Poor child, poor child!&#8221; he thought. &#8220;If I could
only make her well and happy! If I could only bring
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_32' name='page_32'></a>32</span>
her dead lover back to life, how gladly would I put
her in his arms and go away forever!&#8221; And it
seemed to him in some dim way that he had wronged
the poor sufferer; that he was to blame for her
sorrow.</p>
<p>He went on into the library. A lamp was burning
on the table; a Hebrew Bible and a copy of Homer lay
beside it. Along the walls were arranged those heavy
and ponderous tomes in which the theology of the age
was wont to clothe itself.</p>
<p>He seated himself at the table and took up his
Homer; for he was too agitated to sleep. But it was
in vain that he tried to interest himself in it. The
rhythm had lost its music, the thought its power; it
was in vain that he tried to forget himself in the
reply of Achilles, or the struggle over the body of
Patroclus.</p>
<p>Hawthorne tells us that a person of artistic temperament
may at a time of mental depression wander
through the Roman galleries and see nothing in the
finest masterpieces of Raphael or Angelo. The
grace is gone from the picture, the inspiration from
the marble; the one is a meaningless collection of
colors, the other a dull effigy carved in stone.</p>
<p>Something of this mood was on Cecil to-night.
Irresponsive to the grand beauty of the poem he felt
only its undertone of heartache and woe.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is like human life,&#8221; he thought, as he listlessly
turned the pages; &#8220;it is bright on the surface, but
dark and terrible with pain below. What a black
mystery is life! what bitter irony of justice! Hector
is dragged at Achilles&#8217; chariot-wheel, and Paris goes
free. Helen returns to her home in triumph, while
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_33' name='page_33'></a>33</span>
Andromache is left desolate. Did Homer write in
satire, and is the Iliad but a splendid mockery of
justice, human and divine? Or is life so sad that
every tale woven of it must needs become a tragedy?&#8221;</p>
<p>He pondered the gloomy puzzle of human existence
long that night. At length his brain grew
over-weary, and he slept sitting in his chair, his head
resting on the pages of the open book.</p>
<p>How long he slept he knew not, but he awoke with
a start to find a hand laid on his shoulder and the tall
figure of the Indian woman standing beside him. He
sprang up in sudden fear.</p>
<p>&#8220;Is she worse?&#8221; he cried. But the woman, with
that light noiseless step, that mute stolidity so characteristic
of her race, had already glided to the door;
and there was no need for her to answer, for already
his own apprehensions had replied.</p>
<p>He was in the room almost as soon as she. His
wife was much worse; and hastening through the
night to a neighboring farmhouse, he roused its inmates,
despatched a messenger for the physician, and
returned, accompanied by several members of the
neighbor&#8217;s family.</p>
<p>The slow moments dragged away like years as they
watched around her. It seemed as if the doctor
would never come. To the end of his life Cecil never
forgot the long-drawn agony of that night.</p>
<p>At length their strained hearing caught the quick
tread of horses&#8217; hoofs on the turf without.</p>
<p>&#8220;The doctor, the doctor!&#8221; came simultaneously
from the lips of Cecil and the watchers. The doctor,&mdash;there
was hope in the very name.</p>
<p>How eagerly they watched his face as he bent over
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_34' name='page_34'></a>34</span>
the patient! It was a calm, self-contained face, but
they saw a shadow flit over it, a sudden almost imperceptible
change of expression that said &#8220;Death&#8221; as
plainly as if he had spoken it. They could do nothing,
he said,&mdash;nothing but wait for the end to come.</p>
<p>How the moments lingered! Sometimes Cecil bent
over the sufferer with every muscle quivering to her
paroxysms; sometimes he could endure it no longer
and went out into the cool night air or into the library,
where with the mere mechanical instinct of a
student he picked up a book, reading a few lines in it,
then throwing it aside. Yet wherever he was he felt
her sufferings as acutely as when standing by her side.
His whole frame was in keenest sympathy with hers,
his whole being full of pain. So sharp were his sensations
that they imparted an abnormal vigor to his
mind. Every line his eyes met in reading stood out
on the page with wonderful distinctness. The words
seemed pictorial, and his mind grasped abstruse propositions
or involved expressions with marvellous facility.</p>
<p>He noted it, and remembered afterward that he
thought at the time how curious it was that his tortured
sympathies should give him such startling acuteness
of perception.</p>
<p>The slow night waned, the slow dawn crept over
the eastern hills. Cecil stood with haggard eyes at the
foot of the bed, watching the sleeper&#8217;s face. As the
daylight brightened, blending with the light of the still
burning lamps, he saw a change come over her countenance;
the set face relaxed, the look lost its wildness.
A great hope shone in his hollow eyes.</p>
<p>&#8220;She is getting better, she is coming out of her
sufferings,&#8221; he whispered to the doctor.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_35' name='page_35'></a>35</span></div>
<p>&#8220;She will be out of her sufferings very soon,&#8221; he
replied sadly; and then Cecil knew that the end was
at hand. Was it because the peace, the profound
serenity which sometimes is the prelude of death, filling
her being, penetrated his, that he grew so strangely
calm? An inexpressible solemnity came to him as
he looked at her, and all his agitation left him.</p>
<p>Her face grew very sweet and calm, and full of
peace. Her eyes met Cecil&#8217;s, and there was in them
something that seemed to thank him for all his goodness
and patience,&mdash;something that was both benediction
and farewell. Her lips moved, but she was
past the power of speech, and only her eyes thanked
him in a tender, grateful glance.</p>
<p>The sun&#8217;s edge flashed above the horizon, and its
first rays fell through the uncurtained window full
upon her face. She turned toward them, smiling
faintly, and her face grew tenderly, radiantly beautiful,
as if on that beam of sunshine the spirit of her
dead lover had come to greet her from the sea.
Then the sparkle died out of her eyes and the smile
faded from her lips. It was only a white, dead face
that lay there bathed in golden light.</p>
<p>A moment after, Cecil left the house with swift
footsteps and plunged into the adjacent wood. There
under a spreading oak he flung himself prone upon
the earth, and buried his face in his hands. A seething
turmoil of thoughts swept his mind. The past
rose before him like a panorama. All his married
life rushed back upon him, and every memory was
regret and accusation.</p>
<p>&#8220;I might have been kinder to her, I might have
been better,&#8221; he murmured, while the hot tears gushed
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_36' name='page_36'></a>36</span>
from his eyes. &#8220;I might have been so much better
to her,&#8221; he repeated over and over,&mdash;he, whose whole
thought had been to shut up his sorrow in his own heart
and show her only tenderness and consideration.</p>
<p>By and by he grew calmer and sat up, leaning
against the tree and looking out into vacancy with
dim eyes that saw nothing. His heart was desolate,
emptied of everything. What was he to do? What
was he to set before himself? He had not loved
her, but still she had been a part of his life; with
what was he to fill it now?</p>
<p>As he sat there depressed and troubled, a strange
thing happened.</p>
<p>He was looking, as has been said, blindly into vacancy.
It may have been an optical illusion, it may
have been a mere vagary born of an over-wrought
brain; but a picture formed before him. In the distance,
toward the west, he saw something that looked
like a great arch of stone, a natural bridge, rugged
with crags and dark with pine. Beneath it swept a
wide blue river, and on it wild horsemen were crossing
and recrossing, with plumed hair and rude lances.
Their faces were Indian, yet of a type different from
any he had ever seen. The bridge was in the heart
of a mighty mountain-range. On either side rose
sharp and lofty peaks, their sides worn by the action
of water in some remote age.</p>
<p>These details he noted as in a dream; then the
strangeness of it all burst upon him. Even as it did
so, the vision dissolved; the bridge wavered and passed
away, the mountain-peaks sank in shadow. He leaped
to his feet and gazed eagerly. A fine mist seemed
passing before his sight; then he saw only the reach
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_37' name='page_37'></a>37</span>
of hill and woodland, with the morning light resting
upon it.</p>
<p>While the vision faded, he felt springing up within
him an irrepressible desire to follow it. A mysterious
fascination seized him, a wild desire to seek the phantom
bridge. His whole being was swayed as by a supernatural
power toward the west whence the vision
had passed. He started forward eagerly, then checked
himself in bewilderment. What could it mean?</p>
<p>In the nineteenth century, one similarly affected
would think it meant a fevered, a disordered brain;
but in the seventeenth, when statesmen like Cromwell
believed in dreams and omens, and <i>rou&eacute;s</i> like Monmouth
carried charms in their pockets, these things
were differently regarded.</p>
<p>The Puritan ministry, whose minds were imbued
with the gloomy supernaturalism of the Old Testament
on which they fed, were especially men to
whom anything resembling an apparition had a prophetic
significance. And Cecil Grey, though liberal
beyond most New England clergymen, was liable by
the keenness of his susceptibilities and the extreme
sensitiveness of his organization to be influenced by
such delusions,&mdash;if delusions they be. So he stood
awed and trembling, questioning within himself, like
some seer to whom a dark and uncertain revelation
has been made.</p>
<p>Suddenly the answer came.</p>
<p>&#8220;The Lord hath revealed his will unto me and
shown me the path wherein I am to walk,&#8221; he murmured
in a hushed and stricken tone. &#8220;Ruth was
taken from me that I might be free to go where he
should send me. The vision of the Indians and the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_38' name='page_38'></a>38</span>
bridge which faded into the west, and the strange
desire that was given me to follow it, show that the
Lord has another work for me to do. And when I
find the land of the bridge and of the wild people I
saw upon it, then will I find the mission that God has
given me to do. &#8216;Lord God of Israel, I thank Thee.
Thou hast shown me the way, and I will walk in it,
though all its stones be fire and its end be death.&#8217;&#8221;</p>
<p>He stood a moment with bowed head, communing
with his God. Then he returned to his lonely home.</p>
<p>The friends whose kindly sympathies had brought
them to the house of mourning wondered at the erect
carriage, the rapt, exalted manner of the man. His
face was pale, almost as pale as that within the
darkened room; but his eyes shone, and his lips were
closely, resolutely set.</p>
<p>A little while, and that determined face was all sorrowful
and pitying again, as he bent over the still, cold
body of his dead.</p>

<p>A few days after the funeral, letters missive from
the little society went out to all the neighboring
churches, calling a council to ordain the Reverend
Cecil Grey a missionary to the Indians.</p>
<p>It was a novel thing, in spite of the noble example
that Roger Williams had set not many years before;
and the summons met with a general response.</p>
<p>All the churches, far and near, sent delegates. If
one could only have taken a peep, the day before the
council, into the households of that part of New England,
what a glimpse he would have gotten of Puritan
domestic life! What a brushing up there was of
black coats, what a careful starching and ironing of
bands; and above all, in Cecil&#8217;s own neighborhood,
what a mighty cookery for the ordination dinner the
next day! For verily the capacity of the clerical
stomach is marvellous, and is in fact the one thing in
theology that does not change. New departures alter
doctrines, creeds are modified, but the appetite of
the clergy is not subject to such mutations.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_40' name='page_40'></a>40</span></div>
<p>The morrow came, and with it the expected guests.
The meeting house was crowded. There were many
ministers and lay delegates in the council. In the
chair sat a venerable preacher, not unknown in the
records of those days,&mdash;a portly man, with a shrewd
and kindly face. Sterner faces were there also. The
council wore a grave aspect, more like a court of
judges before whom a criminal is cited to appear
than an assembly of clergymen about to ordain a
missionary.</p>
<p>After some preliminaries, Cecil was called on to
give a statement of his reasons for wishing to go as
an evangelist to the Indians. He rose before them.
There was a singular contrast between his slight form
and expressive features and the stout frames and grim
countenances of the others. But the graceful presence
of the man had in it a quiet dignity that commanded
the respect of all.</p>
<p>In obedience to the command, he told how he had
thought of the unknown tribes beyond the Alleghanies,
living in the gloom of paganism and perishing
in darkness, till an intangible sympathy inclined him
toward them,&mdash;till, as it seemed to him, their great
desire for light had entered into and possessed him,
drawing him toward them by a mysterious and irresistible
attraction. He felt called of God to go and
minister to their spiritual needs, and that it was his
duty to leave everything and obey the call.</p>
<p>&#8220;Is this all?&#8221; he was asked.</p>
<p>He hesitated a moment, and then described his
vision in the wood the morning of his wife&#8217;s death.
It made a deep impression on his hearers. There
was scarcely a man in the assembly who was not
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_41' name='page_41'></a>41</span>
tinged with the superstition of the age; and all listened,
not lightly or sceptically, but in awe, as if it
brought them to the threshold of the supernatural.</p>
<p>When the narration was ended, the chairman requested
him to retire, pending the decision of the
council; but first he was asked,&mdash;</p>
<p>&#8220;Are you willing to abide by the decision of this
council, whatever it may be?&#8221;</p>
<p>He raised his head confidently, and his reply came
frank and fearless.</p>
<p>&#8220;I shall respect the opinions of my brethren,
no matter how they may decide; but I shall abide
by the will of God and my own convictions of
duty.&#8221;</p>
<p>The grave Puritan bent his head, half in acknowledgment
of the reply, half in involuntary admiration
of its brave manhood; then Cecil left the room, the
silent, watchful crowd that filled the aisles parting
respectfully to let him pass.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now, brethren,&#8221; said the chairman, &#8220;the matter
is before you. Let us hear from each his judgment
upon it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Solemn and weighty were the opinions delivered.
One brother thought that Mr. Grey had plenty of
work to do at home without going off on a wild-goose
chase after the heathen folk of the wilderness. His
church needed him; to leave it thus would be a shameful
neglect of duty.</p>
<p>Another thought that the Indians were descendants
of the ten lost tribes of Israel, and as such should be
left in the hands of God. To attempt to evangelize
them was to fly in the face of Providence.</p>
<p>Another thought the same; but then, how about
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_42' name='page_42'></a>42</span>
that vision of Mr. Grey? He couldn&#8217;t get around
that vision.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know, brethren, I don&#8217;t know!&#8221; he concluded,
shaking his head.</p>
<p>Still another declared positively for Mr. Grey. The
good people of the colonies owed it to the savages to
do something for their religious enlightenment. It
was wrong that so little had been done. They had
taken their land from them, they had pushed them
back into the wilds at the point of the sword; now let
them try to save their souls. This man had been
plainly called of God to be an apostle to the Indians;
the least that they could do was to bid him
Godspeed and let him go.</p>
<p>So it went on. At length the venerable chairman,
who had twice turned the hour-glass upon the table
before him, rose to close the discussion. His speech
was a singular mixture of shrewdness, benevolence,
and superstition.</p>
<p>He said that, as Christians, they certainly owed a
duty to the Indians,&mdash;a duty that had not been performed.
Mr. Grey wished to help fulfil that neglected
obligation, and would go at his own expense.
It would not cost the church a shilling. His vision
was certainly a revelation of the will of the Lord, and
<i>he</i> dared not stand in the way.</p>
<p>A vote was taken, and the majority were found to
be in favor of ordination. The chairman pronounced
himself pleased, and Mr. Grey was recalled and informed
of the result.</p>
<p>&#8220;I thank you,&#8221; he said simply, with a glad and
grateful smile.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now, brethren,&#8221; said the worthy chairman with
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_43' name='page_43'></a>43</span>
much unction, &#8220;the hour of dinner is nigh at hand,
and the good people of this place have prepared entertainment
for us; so we will e&#8217;en put off the ceremony
of ordination till the afternoon. Let us look to
the Lord for his blessing, and be dismissed.&#8221;</p>
<p>And so with a murmur of talk and comment the
council broke up, its members going to the places
where they were to be entertained. Happy was the
man who returned to his home accompanied by a
minister, while those not so fortunate were fain to be
content with a lay delegate. Indeed, the hospitality
of the settlement was so bounteous that the supply
exceeded the demand. There were not enough
visitors to go around; and more than one good
housewife who had baked, boiled, and roasted all the
day before was moved to righteous indignation at
the sight of the good man of the house returning
guestless from the meeting.</p>
<p>Early in the afternoon entertainers and entertained
gathered again at the meeting-house. Almost the
entire country side was there,&mdash;old and young alike.
The house was packed, for never before had that
part of New England seen a man ordained to carry
the gospel to the Indians. It occurred, too, in that
dreary interval between the persecution of the Quakers
and the persecution of the witches, and was
therefore doubly welcome.</p>
<p>When Cecil arrived, the throng made way reverently
for him. Was he not going, perchance like the
martyrs of old, to the fagot and the stake? To
those who had long known him he seemed hardly
like the same man. He was lifted to a higher plane,
surrounded by an atmosphere of sanctity and heroism,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_44' name='page_44'></a>44</span>
and made sacred by the high mission given him
of God, to which was now to be added the sanction
of holy men.</p>
<p>So they made way for him, as the Florentines had
made way for &#8220;il Frate&#8221; and as the people of God had
made way for Francis Xavier when he left them to
stir the heart of the East with his eloquence, and,
alas! to die on the bleak sea-coast of China, clasping
the crucifix to his breast and praying for those who
had cast him out.</p>
<p>Cecil&#8217;s face, though pale, was calm and noble. All
his nature responded to the moral grandeur of the
occasion. It would be difficult to put into words the
reverent and tender exaltation of feeling that animated
him that day. Perhaps only those upon whose
own heads the hands of ordination have been laid
can enter into or understand it.</p>
<p>The charge was earnest, but it was not needed, for
Cecil&#8217;s ardent enthusiasm went far beyond all that the
speaker urged upon him. As he listened, pausing as
it were on the threshold of an unknown future, he
wondered if he should ever hear a sermon again,&mdash;he,
so soon to be swallowed by darkness, swept, self-yielded,
into the abyss of savagery.</p>
<p>Heartfelt and touching was the prayer of ordination,&mdash;that
God might accept and bless Cecil&#8217;s consecration,
that the divine presence might always abide
with him, that savage hearts might be touched and softened,
that savage lives might be lighted up through
his instrumentality, and that seed might be sown in
the wilderness which would spring up and cause the
waste places to be glad and the desert to blossom as
the rose.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_45' name='page_45'></a>45</span></div>
<p>&#8220;And so,&#8221; said the old minister, his voice faltering
and his hands trembling as they rested on Cecil&#8217;s
bowed head, &#8220;so we give him into Thine own hand
and send him forth into the wilderness. Thou only
knowest what is before him, whether it be a harvest
of souls, or torture and death. But we know that,
for the Christian, persecutions and trials are but
stepping-stones leading to God; yea, and that death
itself is victory. And if he is faithful, we know that
whatever his lot may be it will be glorious; that
whatever the end may be, it will be but a door opening
into the presence of the Most High.&#8221;</p>
<p>Strong and triumphant rang the old man&#8217;s tones, as
he closed his prayer committing Cecil into the hands
of God. To him, as he listened, it seemed as if the
last tie that bound him to New England was severed,
and he stood consecrated and anointed for his
mission. When he raised his face, more than one of
the onlookers thought of those words of the Book
where it speaks of Stephen,&mdash;&#8220;And they saw his face
as it had been the face of an angel.&#8221;</p>
<p>A psalm was sung, the benediction given, and the
solemn service was over. It was long, however, before
the people left the house. They lingered around
Cecil, bidding him farewell, for he was to go forth at
dawn the next day upon his mission. They pressed
his hand, some with warm words of sympathy, some
silently and with wet eyes. Many affectionate words
were said, for they had never known before how
much they loved their pastor; and now he seemed
no longer a pastor, but a martyr and a saint. More
than one mother brought him her child to bless;&mdash;others
strangers from a distance&mdash;lifted their children
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_46' name='page_46'></a>46</span>
up, so that they could see him above the press,
while they whispered to them that they must always
remember that they had seen the good Mr. Grey,
who was going far off into the west to tell the Indians
about God.</p>
<p>Long afterward, when nearly all that generation
had passed away and the storm of the Revolution was
beginning to gather over the colonies, there were a
few aged men still living who sometimes told how,
when they were children, they had seen Cecil Grey
bidding the people farewell at the old meeting-house;
and through all the lapse of years they remembered
what a wonderful brightness was on his face, and how
sweet and kind were his words to each as he bade
them good-by forever.</p>

<p>The next morning Cecil rose early after a sleepless
night. On that day he was to go out from
all that was sweet and precious in life and take the
path into the wilderness. At first his heart sank
within him; then his strength of purpose revived, and
he was resolute again.</p>
<p>He must go, and soon. The briefer the parting
the briefer the pang. He had already bidden his
friends good-by; his parents were long since dead;
it only remained to part from the old Indian woman,
his nurse in childhood, now his faithful housekeeper
and the only inmate of his home.</p>
<p>He went to the kitchen,&mdash;for usually at this hour
she was up and preparing breakfast. She was not
there, and the room looked cold and cheerless in the
gray dawn. He went to her door and knocked;
there was no response. He called her; the room
was as still as death. Alarmed, he opened the door;
no one was within; she was gone,&mdash;had evidently
been gone all night, for the bed was untouched.</p>
<p>He was pained and bewildered at this desertion,
for only the day before he had given her a paper
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_48' name='page_48'></a>48</span>
legally drawn up, securing to her the little property he
possessed and making her independent for the rest
of her life. She had taken it, listened in silence to
the kindly expressions that accompanied the gift, and
turned away without a word. Now she was gone;
what could it mean?</p>
<p>Slowly he made the simple preparations that were
needed for the journey&mdash;putting a little food, his
Bible, and other necessaries into a kind of knapsack
and strapping it upon his back. Then taking his
staff, he went out from his home, never to return.</p>
<p>The sun was rising, the air was fresh and dewy, but
his heart was sad. Yet through it ran a strange thrill
of joy, a strange blending of pain and gladness.</p>
<p>&#8220;The parting is bitter, bitter almost unto death, but
He will keep me,&#8221; murmured the white lips, as he
went down the walk.</p>
<p>The sound of voices fell on his ears, and he looked
up. At the gate, awaiting him, was a group of his
parishioners, who had come to look once more on
the face of their pastor. One by whose bedside he
had prayed in the hour of sickness; another, whom
his counsel had saved when direly tempted; a little
lame child, who loved him for his kindness; and an
aged, dim-sighted woman, to whom he had often read
the Scriptures.</p>
<p>He opened the gate and came out among them.</p>
<p>&#8220;God bless you, sir,&#8221; said the old woman, &#8220;we
wanted to see your bonny face again before you
left us.&#8221;</p>
<p>The little lame boy said nothing, but came up to
Cecil, took his hand, and pressed it to his cheek in
a manner more eloquent than words.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_49' name='page_49'></a>49</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Friends,&#8221; said Cecil, in a faltering voice, &#8220;I
thank you. It is very sweet to know that you care
for me thus.&#8221;</p>
<p>One by one they came and clasped his hand in
tearful farewell. For each he had a loving word. It
was an impressive scene,&mdash;the sorrow-stricken group,
the pastor with his pale spiritual face full of calm resolve,
and around them the solemn hush of morning.</p>
<p>When all had been spoken, the minister reverently
uncovered his head; the others did the same. &#8220;It
is for the last time,&#8221; he said; &#8220;let us pray.&#8221;</p>
<p>After a few earnest words commending them to the
care of God, he drew his hand gently from the lame
boy&#8217;s cheek and rested it on his head in silent benediction.
Then giving them one last look of unutterable
love, a look they never forgot,&mdash;</p>
<p>&#8220;Good-by,&#8221; he said softly, &#8220;God bless you all.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Good-by, God bless <i>you</i>, sir,&#8221; came back in
answer; and they saw his face no more.</p>
<p>One more farewell was yet to be said. The winding
path led close by the country graveyard. He
entered it and knelt by the side of the new-made
grave. Upon the wooden headboard was inscribed
the name of her who slept beneath,&mdash;&#8220;Ruth Grey.&#8221;</p>
<p>He kissed the cold sod, his tears falling fast
upon it.</p>
<p>&#8220;Forgive me,&#8221; he whispered, as if the dull ear of
death could hear. &#8220;Forgive me for everything
wherein I failed you. Forgive me, and&mdash;Farewell.&#8221;</p>
<p>Again he was on his way. At the entrance to the
wood he saw a figure sitting on a rock beside the
path. As he drew nearer he observed it was clad in
Indian garb, and evidently awaited his coming. Who
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_50' name='page_50'></a>50</span>
was it? Might it not be some chief, who, having
heard of his intended mission, had come forth to
meet him?</p>
<p>He hastened his steps. When he came nearer, he
saw that it was only an Indian woman; a little closer,
and to his inexpressible astonishment he recognized
his old nurse.</p>
<p>&#8220;What does this mean?&#8221; he exclaimed. &#8220;What
are you doing here, and in Indian garb, too?&#8221;</p>
<p>She rose to her feet with simple, natural dignity.</p>
<p>&#8220;It means,&#8221; she said, &#8220;that I go with you. Was
I not your nurse in childhood? Did I not carry you
in my arms then, and has not your roof sheltered me
since? Can I forsake him who is as my own child?
My heart has twined around you too long to be
torn away. Your path shall be my path; we go
together.&#8221;</p>
<p>It was in vain that Cecil protested, reasoned,
argued.</p>
<p>&#8220;I have spoken,&#8221; she said. &#8220;I will not turn back
from my words while life is left me.&#8221;</p>
<p>He would have pleaded longer, but she threw a
light pack upon her back and went on into the forest.
She had made her decision, and he knew she would
adhere to it with the inflexible obstinacy of her race.</p>
<p>He could only follow her regretfully; and yet he
could not but be grateful for her loyalty.</p>

<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_52' name='page_52'></a>52</span></div>
<p>At the edge of the wood he paused and looked
back. Before him lay the farms and orchards of the
Puritans. Here and there a flock of sheep was being
driven from the fold into the pasture, and a girl,
bucket in hand, was taking her way to the milking
shed. From each farmhouse a column of smoke rose
into the clear air. Over all shone the glory of the
morning sun. It was civilization; it was New England;
it was <i>home</i>.</p>
<p>For a moment, the scene seemed literally to lay
hold of him and pull him back. For a moment, all
the domestic feelings, all the refinement in his nature,
rose up in revolt against the rude contact with barbarism
before him. It seemed as if he could not go on,
as if he must go back. He shook like a leaf with the
mighty conflict.</p>
<p>&#8220;My God!&#8221; he cried out, throwing up his arms
with a despairing gesture, &#8220;must I give up everything,
everything?&#8221;</p>
<p>He felt his resolution giving way; his gray eyes
were dark and dilated with excitement and pain; his
long fingers twitched and quivered; before he knew
what he was doing, he was walking back toward the
settlement.</p>
<p>That brought him to himself; that re-awakened the
latent energy and decision of his character.</p>
<p>&#8220;What! shall I turn back from the very threshold
of my work? God forgive me&mdash;never!&#8221;</p>
<p>His delicate frame grew strong and hardy under the
power of his indomitable spirit. Again his dauntless
enthusiasm came back; again he was the Apostle to
the Indians.</p>
<p>One long last look, and he disappeared in the
shadows of the wood, passing forever from the ken
of the white man; for only vague rumors floated
back to the colonies from those mysterious wilds into
which he had plunged. The strange and wondrous
tale of his after-life New England never knew.</p>

</td></tr></table>
<p>Two hundred years ago&mdash;as near as we can
estimate the time from the dim and shadowy legends
that have come down to us&mdash;the confederacy
of the Wauna or Columbia was one of the most powerful
the New World has ever seen. It was apparently not
inferior to that of the Six Nations, or to the more
transitory leagues with which Tecumseh or Pontiac
stayed for a moment the onward march of the white
man. It was a union of the Indian tribes of Oregon
and Washington, with the Willamettes at the head,
against their great hereditary enemies, the Nootkas,
the Shoshones, and the Spokanes.</p>
<p>Sonorous and picturesque was the language of the
old Oregon Indians in telling the first white traders
the story of the great alliance.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_54' name='page_54'></a>54</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Once, long before my father&#8217;s time and before
his father&#8217;s time, all the tribes were as one tribe and
the Willamettes were <i>tyee</i> [chief]. The Willamettes
were strong and none could stand against them. The
heart of the Willamette was battle and his hand was
blood. When he lifted his arm in war, his enemy&#8217;s
lodge became ashes and his council silence and death.</p>
<p>&#8220;The war-trails of the Willamette went north and
south and east, and there was no grass on them. He
called the Chinook and Sound Indians, who were weak,
his children, and the Yakima, Cayuse, and Wasco,
who loved war, his brothers; but <i>he</i> was elder brother.
And the Spokanes and the Shoshones might fast and
cut themselves with thorns and knives, and dance the
medicine dance, and drink the blood of horses, but
nothing could make their hearts as strong as the hearts
of the Willamettes; for the One up in the sky had told
the old men and the dreamers that the Willamettes
should be the strongest of all the tribes as long as the
Bridge of the Gods should stand. That was their
<i>tomanowos</i>.&#8221;</p>
<p>But whenever the white listener asked about this
superstition of the bridge and the legend connected
with it, the Indian would at once become uncommunicative,
and say, &#8220;You can&#8217;t understand,&#8221; or more
frequently, &#8220;I don&#8217;t know.&#8221; For the main difficulty
in collecting these ancient tales&mdash;&#8220;old-man talk,&#8221; as
the Siwashes call them&mdash;was, that there was much
superstition interwoven with them; and the Indians
were so reticent about their religious beliefs, that if
one was not exceedingly cautious, the lively, gesticulating
talker of one moment was liable to become the
personification of sullen obstinacy the next.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_55' name='page_55'></a>55</span></div>
<p>But if the listener was fortunate enough to strike
the golden mean, being neither too anxious nor too
indifferent, and if above all he had by the gift of
bounteous <i>muck-a-muck</i> [food] touched the chord
to which the savage heart always responds, the Indian
might go on and tell in broken English or crude
Chinook the strange, dark legend of the bridge, which
is the subject of our tale.</p>
<p>At the time our story opens, this confederacy was
at the height of its power. It was a rough-hewn, barbarian
realm, the most heterogeneous, the most rudimentary
of alliances. The exact manner of its union,
its laws, its extent, and its origin are all involved in the
darkness which everywhere covers the history of Indian
Oregon,&mdash;a darkness into which our legend casts
but a ray of light that makes the shadows seem
the denser. It gives us, however, a glimpse of the
diverse and squalid tribes that made up the confederacy.
This included the &#8220;Canoe Indians&#8221; of the
Sound and of the Oregon sea-coast, whose flat heads,
greasy squat bodies, and crooked legs were in marked
contrast with their skill and dexterity in managing
their canoes and fish-spears; the hardy Indians of
the Willamette Valley and the Cascade Range; and
the bold, predatory riders of eastern Oregon and
Washington,&mdash;buffalo hunters and horse tamers, passionately
fond, long before the advent of the white
man, of racing and gambling. It comprised also
the Okanogans, who disposed of their dead by tying
them upright to a tree; the Yakimas, who buried
them under cairns of stone; the Klickitats, who
swathed them like mummies and laid them in low,
rude huts on the <i>mimaluse</i>, or &#8220;death islands&#8221; of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_56' name='page_56'></a>56</span>
the Columbia; the Chinooks, who stretched them in
canoes with paddles and fishing implements by their
side; and the Kalamaths, who burned them with the
maddest saturnalia of dancing, howling, and leaping
through the flames of the funeral pyre. Over sixty
or seventy petty tribes stretched the wild empire,
welded together by the pressure of common foes
and held in the grasp of the hereditary war-chief of
the Willamettes.</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>The chiefs of the Willamettes had gathered on
Wappatto Island, from time immemorial the council-ground
of the tribes. The white man has changed
its name to &#8220;Sauvie&#8217;s&#8221; Island; but its wonderful
beauty is unchangeable. Lying at the mouth of the
Willamette River and extending for many miles down
the Columbia, rich in wide meadows and crystal lakes,
its interior dotted with majestic oaks and its shores
fringed with cottonwoods, around it the blue and
sweeping rivers, the wooded hills, and the far white
snow peaks,&mdash;it is the most picturesque spot in
Oregon.</p>
<p>The chiefs were assembled in secret council, and
only those of pure Willamette blood were present,
for the question to be considered was not one to be
known by even the most trusted ally.</p>
<p>All the confederated tribes beyond the Cascade
Range were in a ferment of rebellion. One of the
petty tribes of eastern Oregon had recently risen up
against the Willamette supremacy; and after a short
but bloody struggle, the insurrection had been put
down and the rebels almost exterminated by the victorious
Willamettes.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_57' name='page_57'></a>57</span></div>
<p>But it was known that the chief of the malcontents
had passed from tribe to tribe before the struggle
commenced, inciting them to revolt, and it was
suspected that a secret league had been formed;
though when matters came to a crisis, the confederates,
afraid to face openly the fierce warriors of the
Willamette, had stood sullenly back, giving assistance
to neither side. It was evident, however, that a spirit
of angry discontent was rife among them. Threatening
language had been used by the restless chiefs beyond
the mountains; braves had talked around the
camp-fire of the freedom of the days before the yoke
of the confederacy was known; and the gray old
dreamers, with whom the <i>mimaluse tillicums</i> [dead
people] talked, had said that the fall of the Willamettes
was near at hand.</p>
<p>The sachems of the Willamettes, advised of everything,
were met in council in the soft Oregon spring-tide.
They were gathered under the cottonwood
trees, not far from the bank of the Columbia. The
air was fresh with the scent of the waters, and the
young leaves were just putting forth on the &#8220;trees of
council,&#8221; whose branches swayed gently in the breeze.
Beneath them, their bronze faces more swarthy still
as the dancing sunbeams fell upon them through the
moving boughs, thirty sachems sat in close semi-circle
before their great war-chief, Multnomah.</p>
<p>It was a strange, a sombre assembly. The chiefs
were for the most part tall, well-built men, warriors and
hunters from their youth up. There was something
fierce and haughty in their bearing, something menacing,
violent, and lawless in their saturnine faces and
black, glittering eyes. Most of them wore their hair
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_58' name='page_58'></a>58</span>
long; some plaited, others flowing loosely over their
shoulders. Their ears were loaded with <i>hiagua</i> shells;
their dress was composed of buckskin leggings and
moccasins, and a short robe of dressed skin that came
from the shoulders to the knees, to which was added
a kind of blanket woven of the wool of the mountain
sheep, or an outer robe of skins or furs, stained various
colors and always drawn close around the body
when sitting or standing. Seated on rude mats of
rushes, wrapped each in his outer blanket and doubly
wrapped in Indian stoicism, the warriors were ranged
before their chief.</p>
<p>His garb did not differ from that of the others, except
that his blanket was of the richest fur known to
the Indians, so doubled that the fur showed on either
side. His bare arms were clasped each with a rough
band of gold; his hair was cut short, in sign of
mourning for his favorite wife, and his neck was
adorned with a collar of large bear-claws, showing he
had accomplished that proudest of all achievements
for the Indian,&mdash;the killing of a grizzly.</p>
<p>Until the last chief had entered the grove and
taken his place in the semi-circle, Multnomah sat like
a statue of stone. He leaned forward reclining on
his bow, a fine unstrung weapon tipped with gold.
He was about sixty years old, his form tall and stately,
his brow high, his eyes black, overhung with shaggy
gray eyebrows and piercing as an eagle&#8217;s. His dark,
grandly impassive face, with its imposing regularity of
feature, showed a penetration that read everything, a
reserve that revealed nothing, a dominating power
that gave strength and command to every line. The
lip, the brow, the very grip of the hand on the bow
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_59' name='page_59'></a>59</span>
told of a despotic temper and an indomitable will.
The glance that flashed out from this reserved and
resolute face&mdash;sharp, searching, and imperious&mdash;may
complete the portrait of Multnomah, the silent,
the secret, the terrible.</p>
<p>When the last late-entering chief had taken his
place, Multnomah rose and began to speak, using
the royal language; for like the Cayuses and several
other tribes of the Northwest, the Willamettes had
two languages,&mdash;the common, for every-day use, and
the royal, spoken only by the chiefs in council.</p>
<p>In grave, strong words he laid before them the
troubles that threatened to break up the confederacy
and his plan for meeting them. It was to send out
runners calling a council of all the tribes, including
the doubtful allies, and to try before them and execute
the rebellious chief, who had been taken alive
and was now reserved for the torture. Such a council,
with the terrible warning of the rebel&#8217;s death
enacted before it, would awe the malcontents into
submission or drive them into open revolt. Long
enough had the allies spoken with two tongues; long
enough had they smoked the peace-pipe with both
the Willamettes and their enemies. They must come
now to peace that should be peace, or to open war.
The chief made no gestures, his voice did not vary
its stern, deliberate accents from first to last; but
there was an indefinable something in word and
manner that told how his warlike soul thirsted for
battle, how the iron resolution, the ferocity beneath
his stoicism, burned with desire of vengeance.</p>
<p>There was perfect attention while he spoke,&mdash;not
so much as a glance or a whisper aside. When he
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_60' name='page_60'></a>60</span>
had ceased and resumed his seat, silence reigned for
a little while. Then Tla-wau-wau, chief of the Klackamas,
a sub-tribe of the Willamette, rose. He laid
aside his outer robe, leaving bare his arms and shoulders,
which were deeply scarred; for Tla-wau-wau
was a mighty warrior, and as such commanded. With
measured deliberation he spoke in the royal tongue.</p>
<p>&#8220;Tla-wau-wau has seen many winters, and his hair
is very gray. Many times has he watched the grass
spring up and grow brown and wither, and the snows
come and go, and those things have brought him wisdom,
and what he has seen of life and death has given
him strong thoughts. It is not well to leap headlong
into a muddy stream, lest there be rocks under the
black water. Shall we call the tribes to meet us here
on the island of council? When they are all gathered
together they are more numerous than we. Is
it wise to call those that are stronger than ourselves
into our wigwam, when their hearts are bitter against
us? Who knows what plots they might lay, or how
suddenly they might fall on us at night or in the day
when we were unprepared? Can we trust them?
Does not the Klickitat&#8217;s name mean &#8216;he that steals
horses&#8217;? The Yakima would smoke the peace-pipe
with the knife that was to stab you hid under his
blanket. The Wasco&#8217;s heart is a lie, and his tongue
is a trap.</p>
<p>&#8220;No, let us wait. The tribes talk great swelling
words now and their hearts are hot, but if we wait,
the fire will die down and the words grow small. Then
we can have a council and be knit together again.
Let us wait till another winter has come and gone;
then let us meet in council, and the tribes will listen.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_61' name='page_61'></a>61</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Tla-wau-wau says, &#8216;wait, and all will be well.&#8217;&#8221;</p>
<p>His earnest, emphatic words ended, the chief took
his seat and resumed his former look of stolid indifference.
A moment before he had been all animation,
every glance and gesture eloquent with meaning; now
he sat seemingly impassive and unconcerned.</p>
<p>There was another pause. It was so still that the
rustling of the boughs overhead was startlingly distinct.
Saving the restless glitter of black eyes, it was
a tableau of stoicism. Then another spoke, advising
caution, setting forth the danger of plunging into a
contest with the allies. Speaker followed speaker in
the same strain.</p>
<p>As they uttered the words counselling delay, the
glance of the war-chief grew ever brighter, and his grip
upon the bow on which he leaned grew harder. But
the cold face did not relax a muscle. At length rose
Mishlah the Cougar, chief of the Mollalies. His was
one of the most singular faces there. His tangled
hair fell around a sinister, bestial countenance, all
scarred and seamed by wounds received in battle.
His head was almost flat, running back from his
eyebrows so obliquely that when he stood erect he
seemed to have no forehead at all; while the back and
lower part of his head showed an enormous development,&mdash;a
development that was all animal. He knew
nothing but battle, and was one of the most dreaded
warriors of the Willamettes.</p>
<p>He spoke,&mdash;not in the royal language, as did the
others, but in the common dialect, the only one of
which he was master.</p>
<p>&#8220;My heart is as the heart of Multnomah. Mishlah
is hungry for war. If the tribes that are our younger
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_62' name='page_62'></a>62</span>
brothers are faithful, they will come to the council
and smoke the pipe of peace with us; if they are
not, let us know it. Mishlah knows not what it is to
wait. You all talk words, words, words; and the
tribes laugh and say, &#8216;The Willamettes have become
women and sit in the lodge sewing moccasins
and are afraid to fight.&#8217; Send out the runners. Call
the council. Let us find who are our enemies; then
let us strike!&#8221;</p>
<p>The hands of the chief closed involuntarily as if
they clutched a weapon, and his voice rang harsh and
grating. The eyes of Multnomah flashed fire, and
the war-lust kindled for a moment on the dark faces
of the listeners.</p>
<p>Then rose the grotesque figure of an Indian, ancient,
withered, with matted locks and haggard face,
who had just joined the council, gliding in noiselessly
from the neighboring wood. His cheek-bones were
unusually high, his lower lip thick and protruding, his
eyes deeply sunken, his face drawn, austere, and dismal
beyond description. The mis-shapen, degraded
features repelled at first sight; but a second glance
revealed a great dim sadness in the eyes, a gloomy
foreboding on brow and lip that were weirdly fascinating,
so sombre were they, so full of woe. There
was a wild dignity in his mien; and he wore the robe
of furs, though soiled and torn, that only the richest
chiefs were able to wear. Such was Tohomish, or
Pine Voice, chief of the Santiam tribe of the Willamettes,
the most eloquent orator and potent medicine
or <i>tomanowos</i> man in the confederacy.</p>
<p>There was a perceptible movement of expectation,
a lighting up of faces as he arose, and a shadow of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_63' name='page_63'></a>63</span>
anxiety swept over Multnomah&#8217;s impassive features.
For this man&#8217;s eloquence was wonderful, and his soft
magnetic tones could sway the passions of his hearers
to his will with a power that seemed more than human
to the superstitious Indians. Would he declare for
the council or against it; for peace or for war?</p>
<p>He threw back the tangled locks that hung over
his face, and spoke.</p>
<p>&#8220;Chiefs and warriors, who dwell in lodges and talk
with men, Tohomish, who dwells in caves and talks
with the dead, says greeting, and by him the dead
send greeting also.&#8221;</p>
<p>His voice was wonderfully musical, thrilling, and
pathetic; and as he spoke the salutation from the
dead, a shudder went through the wild audience
before him,&mdash;through all but Multnomah, who
did not shrink nor drop his searching eyes from
the speaker&#8217;s face. What cared he for the salutation
of the living or the dead? Would this man
whose influence was so powerful declare for action
or delay?</p>
<p>&#8220;It has been long since Tohomish has stood in the
light of the sun and looked on the faces of his brothers
or heard their voices. Other faces has he looked
upon and other voices has he heard. He has learned
the language of the birds and the trees, and has talked
with the People of Old who dwell in the serpent and
the cayote; and they have taught him their secrets.
But of late terrible things have come to Tohomish.&#8221;</p>
<p>He paused, and the silence was breathless, for the
Indians looked on this man as a seer to whom the
future was as luminous as the past. But Multnomah&#8217;s
brow darkened; he felt that Tohomish also
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_64' name='page_64'></a>64</span>
was against him, and the soul of the warrior rose up
stern and resentful against the prophet.</p>
<p>&#8220;A few suns ago, as I wandered in the forest by
the Santiam, I heard the death-wail in the distance.
I said, &#8216;Some one is dead, and that is the cry of the
mourners. I will go and lift up my voice with them.&#8217;
But as I sought them up the hill and through the
thickets the cry grew fainter and farther, till at last it
died out amid distant rocks and crags. And then I
knew that I had heard no human voice lamenting the
dead, but that it was the Spirit Indian-of-the-Wood
wailing for the living whose feet go down to the darkness
and whose faces the sun shall soon see no more.
Then my heart grew heavy and bitter, for I knew that
woe had come to the Willamettes.</p>
<p>&#8220;I went to my den in the mountains, and sought
to know of those that dwell in the night the meaning
of this. I built the medicine-fire, I fasted, I refused
to sleep. Day and night I kept the fire burning;
day and night I danced the <i>tomanowos</i> dance around
the flames, or leaped through them, singing the song
that brings the <i>Spee-ough</i>, till at last the life went
from my limbs and my head grew sick and everything
was a whirl of fire. Then I knew that the
power was on me, and I fell, and all grew black.</p>
<p>&#8220;I dreamed a dream.</p>
<p>&#8220;I stood by the death-trail that leads to the spirit-land.
The souls of those who had just died were
passing; and as I gazed, the wail I had heard in the
forest came back, but nearer than before. And as
the wail sounded, the throng on the death-trail grew
thicker and their tread swifter. The warrior passed
with his bow in his hand and his quiver swinging from
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_65' name='page_65'></a>65</span>
his shoulder; the squaw followed with his food upon
her back; the old tottered by. It was a whole
people on the way to the spirit-land. But when I
tried to see their faces, to know them, if they were
Willamette or Shoshone or our brother tribes, I could
not. But the wail grew ever louder and the dead
grew ever thicker as they passed. Then it all faded
out, and I slept. When I awoke, it was night; the
fire had burned into ashes and the medicine wolf was
howling on the hills. The voices that are in the air
came to me and said, &#8216;Go to the council and tell
what you have seen;&#8217; but I refused, and went far
into the wood to avoid them. But the voices would
not let me rest, and my spirit burned within me, and
I came. Beware of the great council. Send out no
runners. Call not the tribes together. Voices and
omens and dreams tell Tohomish of something terrible
to come. The trees whisper it; it is in the air,
in the waters. It has made my spirit bitter and
heavy until my drink seems blood and my food has
the taste of death. Warriors, Tohomish has shown
his heart. His words are ended.&#8221;</p>
<p>He resumed his seat and drew his robe about him,
muffling the lower part of his face. The matted hair
fell once more over his drooping brow and repulsive
countenance, from which the light faded the moment
he ceased to speak. Again the silence was profound.
The Indians sat spell-bound, charmed by the
mournful music of the prophet&#8217;s voice and awed by
the dread vision he had revealed. All the superstition
within them was aroused. When Tohomish took
his seat, every Indian was ready to oppose the calling
of the council with all his might. Even Mishlah, as
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_66' name='page_66'></a>66</span>
superstitious as blood-thirsty, was startled and perplexed.
The war-chief stood alone.</p>
<p>He knew it, but it only made his despotic will the
stronger. Against the opposition of the council and
the warning of Tohomish, against <i>tomanowos</i> and
<i>Spee-ough</i>, ominous as they were even to him, rose up
the instinct which was as much a part of him as life
itself,&mdash;the instinct to battle and to conquer. He
was resolved with all the grand strength of his nature
to bend the council to his will, and with more than
Indian subtility saw how it might be done.</p>
<p>He rose to his feet and stood for a moment in
silence, sweeping with his glance the circle of chiefs.
As he did so, the mere personality of the man began
to produce a reaction. For forty years he had been
the great war-chief of the tribes of the Wauna, and
had never known defeat. The ancient enemies of
his race dreaded him; the wandering bands of the
prairies had carried his name far and wide; and even
beyond the Rockies, Sioux and Pawnee had heard
rumors of the powerful chief by the Big River of the
West. He stood before them a huge, stern warrior,
himself a living assurance of victory and dominion.</p>
<p>As was customary with Indian orators in preparing
the way for a special appeal, he began to recount the
deeds of the fathers, the valor of the ancient heroes
of the race. His stoicism fell from him as he half
spoke, half chanted the harangue. The passion that
was burning within him made his words like pictures,
so vivid they were, and thrilled his tones with electric
power. As he went on, the sullen faces of his hearers
grew animated; the superstitious fears that Tohomish
had awakened fell from them. Again they were
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_67' name='page_67'></a>67</span>
warriors, and their blood kindled and their pulses
throbbed to the words of their invincible leader. He
saw it, and began to speak of the battles they themselves
had fought and the victories they had gained.
More than one dark cheek flushed darker and more
than one hand moved unconsciously to the knife. He
alluded to the recent war and to the rebellious tribe
that had been destroyed.</p>
<p>&#8220;<i>That</i>,&#8221; said he, &#8220;was the people Tohomish saw
passing over the death-trail in his dream. What
wonder that the thought of death should fill the air,
when we have slain a whole people at a single blow!
Do we not know too that their spirits would try to
frighten our dreamers with omens and bad <i>tomanowos</i>?
Was it not bad <i>tomanowos</i> that Tohomish saw?
It could not have come from the Great Spirit, for
he spoke to our fathers and said that we should be
strongest of all the tribes as long as the Bridge of the
Gods should stand. Have the stones of that bridge
begun to crumble, that our hearts should grow
weak?&#8221;</p>
<p>He then described the natural bridge which, as tradition
and geology alike tell us, spanned at that time
the Columbia at the Cascades. The Great Spirit, he
declared, had spoken; and as he had said, so it would
be. Dreams and omens were mist and shadow, but
the bridge was rock, and the word of the Great Spirit
stood forever. On this tradition the chief dwelt with
tremendous force, setting against the superstition that
Tohomish had roused the still more powerful superstition
of the bridge,&mdash;a superstition so interwoven
with every thought and hope of the Willamettes that
it had become a part of their character as a tribe.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_68' name='page_68'></a>68</span></div>
<p>And now when their martial enthusiasm and fatalistic
courage were all aglow, when the recital of
their fathers&#8217; deeds had stirred their blood and the
portrayal of their own victories filled them again with
the fierce joy of conflict, when the mountain of stone
that arched the Columbia had risen before them in
assurance of dominion as eternal as itself,&mdash;now,
when in every eye gleamed desire of battle and every
heart was aflame, the chief made (and it was characteristic
of him) in one terse sentence his crowning
appeal,&mdash;</p>
<p>&#8220;Chiefs, speak your heart. Shall the runners be
sent out to call the council?&#8221;</p>
<p>There was a moment of intense silence. Then a
low, deep murmur of consent came from the excited
listeners: a half-smothered war-cry burst from the
lips of Mishlah, and the victory was won.</p>
<p>One only sat silent and apart, his robe drawn
close, his head bent down, seemingly oblivious of
all around him, as if resigned to inevitable doom.</p>
<p>&#8220;To-morrow at dawn, while the light is yet young,
the runners will go out. Let the chiefs meet here
in the grove to hear the message given them to be
carried to the tribes. The talk is ended.&#8221;</p>

<p>The war-chief left the grove as soon as he had
dismissed the council. Tohomish went with
him. For some distance they walked together, the
one erect and majestic, the other gliding like a
shadow by his side.</p>
<p>At length Multnomah stopped under a giant cottonwood
and looked sternly at Tohomish.</p>
<p>&#8220;You frightened the council to-day with bad <i>mimaluse</i>
[death] talk. Why did you do it? Why did
you bring into a council of warriors dreams fit only
for old men that lie sleeping in the sun by the door
of the wigwam?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I said what my eyes saw and my ears heard, and
it was true.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It cannot be true, for the Great Spirit has said
that the Willamettes shall rule the tribes as long as
the bridge shall stand; and how can it fall when it
is a mountain of stone?&#8221;</p>
<p>A strange expression crossed Tohomish&#8217;s sullen
face.</p>
<p>&#8220;Multnomah, beware how you rest on the prophecy
of the bridge. Lean not your hand on it, for it is
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_70' name='page_70'></a>70</span>
as if you put it forth to lean it on a coiled rattlesnake.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Your sayings are dark,&#8221; replied the chief impatiently.
&#8220;Speak plainly.&#8221;</p>
<p>Tohomish shook his head, and the gloomy look
habitual to him came back.</p>
<p>&#8220;I cannot. Dreams and omens I can tell, but the
secret of the bridge is the secret of the Great Spirit;
and I cannot tell it lest he become angry and take
from me my power of moving men with burning
words.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The secret of the Great Spirit! What black
thing is it you are hiding and covering up with words?
Bring it forth into the light, that I may see it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, it is my <i>tomanowos</i>. Were I to tell it the
gift of eloquence would go from me, the fire would
die from my heart and the words from my lips, and
my life would wither up within me.&#8221;</p>
<p>Multnomah was silent. Massive and commanding
as was his character he was still an Indian, and the
words of the seer had touched the latent superstition
in his nature. They referred to that strongest and
most powerful of all the strange beliefs of the Oregon
savages,&mdash;the spirit possession or devil worship of
the <i>tomanowos</i>.</p>
<p>As soon as an Oregon Indian was old enough to
aspire to a place among the braves, he was sent
into the hills alone. There he fasted, prayed, and
danced, chanted the medicine-chant, and cut himself
with knife or thorn till he fell exhausted to the
ground. Whatever he saw then, in waking delirium
or feverish sleep, was the charm that was to control
his future. Be it bird or beast, dream or mystic revelation,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_71' name='page_71'></a>71</span>
it was his <i>totem</i> or <i>tomanowos</i>, and gave him
strength, cunning, or swiftness, sometimes knowledge
of the future, imparting to him its own characteristics.
But <i>what</i> it was, its name or nature, was
the one secret that must go with him to his grave.
Woe unto him if he told the name of his <i>totem</i>. In
that moment it would desert him, taking from him all
strength and power, leaving him a shattered wreck,
an outcast from camp and war-party.</p>
<p>&#8220;Multnomah says well that it is a black secret, but
it is my <i>totem</i> and may not be told. For many winters
Tohomish has carried it in his breast, till its poisoned
sap has filled his heart with bitterness, till for
him gladness and warmth have gone out of the light,
laughter has grown a sob of pain, and sorrow and
death have become what the feast, the battle, and the
chase are to other men. It is the black secret, the
secret of the coming trouble, that makes Tohomish&#8217;s
voice like the voice of a pine; so that men say it has
in it sweetness and mystery and haunting woe, moving
the heart as no other can. And if he tells the secret,
eloquence and life go with it. Shall Tohomish tell
it? Will Multnomah listen while Tohomish shows
what is to befall the bridge and the Willamettes in
the time that is to come?&#8221;</p>
<p>The war-chief gazed at him earnestly. In that
troubled, determined look, superstition struggled for
a moment and then gave way to the invincible
obstinacy of his resolve.</p>
<p>&#8220;No. Multnomah knows that his own heart is
strong and will not fail him, come what may; and
that is all he cares to know. If you told me, the
<i>tomanowos</i> would be angry, and drain your spirit
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_72' name='page_72'></a>72</span>
from you and cast you aside as the serpent casts its
skin. And you must be the most eloquent of all at
the great council; for there the arm of Multnomah
and the voice of Tohomish must bend the bad chiefs
before them.&#8221;</p>
<p>His accents had the same undertone of arbitrary
will, of inflexible determination, that had been in
them when he spoke in the council. Though the
shadows fell more and more ominous and threatening
across his path, to turn back did not occur to him.
The stubborn tenacity of the man could not let go his
settled purpose.</p>
<p>&#8220;Tohomish will be at the council and speak for
his chief and his tribe?&#8221; asked Multnomah, in a tone
that was half inquiry, half command; for the seer
whose mysterious power as an orator gave him
so strong an influence over the Indians must be
there.</p>
<p>Tohomish&#8217;s haggard and repulsive face had settled
back into the look of mournful apathy habitual to him.
He had not, since the council, attempted to change
the chief&#8217;s decision by a single word, but seemed to
have resigned himself with true Indian fatalism to that
which was to come.</p>
<p>&#8220;Tohomish will go to the council,&#8221; he said in
those soft and lingering accents, indescribably sweet
and sad, with which his degraded face contrasted so
strongly. &#8220;Yes, he will go to the council, and his
voice shall bend and turn the hearts of men as never
before. Strong will be the words that he shall say, for
with him it will be sunset and his voice will be heard
no more.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_73' name='page_73'></a>73</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Where will you go when the council is ended, that
we shall see you no more?&#8221; asked Multnomah.</p>
<p>&#8220;On the death-trail to the spirit-land,&mdash;nor will
I go alone,&#8221; was the startling reply; and the seer
glided noiselessly away and disappeared among the
trees.</p>

<p>Multnomah passed on to seek the lodge of
his daughter Wallulah, a half Asiatic, and the
most beautiful woman in all the land of the Wauna.</p>
<p>Reader, would you know the tale of the fair oriental
of whom was born the sweet beauty of Wallulah?</p>
<p>Eighteen years before the time of our story, an
East Indian ship was wrecked on the Columbia bar,
the crew and cargo falling into the hands of the
Indians. Among the rescued was a young and exceedingly
lovely woman, who was hospitably entertained
by the chief of the tribe. He and his people
were deeply impressed by the grace of the fair
stranger, whose dainty beauty won for her the name
of &#8220;Sea-Flower,&#8221; because the sea, that is ever drifting
weeds, had for once wafted a flower to the shore.</p>
<p>As she sat on the mat in the rude bark lodge, the
stern chief softened his voice, trying to talk with
her; the uncouth women gently stroked her long soft
hair, and some of the bolder and more curious
touched her white hands wonderingly, while the
throng of dusky faces pressed close round the pale,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_75' name='page_75'></a>75</span>
sweet creature whose eyes looked at them with a
deep, dumb woe they could not understand.</p>
<p>When she had become familiar with the Willamette
tongue, she told them that she was the daughter of a
chief far away across the great water, who ruled a
country as broad as the land of the Wauna and far
richer. He had sent her as a bride to the ruler of
another land, with a fabulous dowry of jewels and
a thousand gifts besides. But the ship that bore her
and her splendid treasures had been turned from its
course by a terrible storm. Day after day it was
driven through a waste of blackness and foam,&mdash;the
sails rent, the masts swept away, the shattered hulk
hurled onward like a straw by the fury of the wind.
When the tempest had spent itself, they found themselves
in a strange sea under strange stars. Compass
and chart were gone; they knew not where they
were, and caught in some unknown current, they
could only drift blindly on and on. Never sighting
land, seeing naught but the everlasting sweep of wave
and sky, it began to be whispered in terror that this
ocean had no further shore, that they might sail on
forever, seeing nothing but the boundless waters. At
length, when the superstitious sailors began to talk of
throwing their fair charge overboard as an offering to
the gods, the blue peaks of the Coast Range rose out
of the water, and the ever rain-freshened green of the
Oregon forests dawned upon them. <a name="page75"></a>Then came the
attempt to enter the Columbia, and the wreck on
the bar.<a name='FNanchor_0001' id='FNanchor_0001'></a><a href='#Footnote_0001' class='fnanchor'>[1]</a></p>

<p>Multnomah made the lovely princess his wife, and
Sea-Flower showed the spirit of a queen. She
tried to introduce among the Indians something of
the refinement of her oriental home. From her the
degraded medicine-men and dreamers caught a gleam
of the majestic lore of Buddha; to the chiefs-in-council
she taught something of the grave, inexorable
justice of the East, that seemed like a higher development
of their own grim unwritten code. Her influence
was very great, for she was naturally eloquent
and of noble presence. More than one sachem felt
the inspiration of better, purer thoughts than he had
ever known before when the &#8220;war-chief&#8217;s woman&#8221;
spoke in council. Strange gatherings were those:
blood-stained chiefs and savage warriors listening all
intent to the sweetest of Indian tongues spoken
in modulations that were music; the wild heart of
the empire stirred by the perfumed breath of a
woman!</p>
<p>She had died three years before the events we
have been narrating, and had left to her daughter
the heritage of her refinement and her beauty.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_77' name='page_77'></a>77</span>
Wallulah was the only child of the war-chief and
his Asiatic wife, the sole heir of her father&#8217;s
sovereignty.</p>
<p>Two miles from the council grove, in the interior
of the island, was Wallulah&#8217;s lodge. The path that
Multnomah took led through a pleasant sylvan lawn.
The grass was green, and the air full of the scent of buds
and flowers. Here and there a butterfly floated like
a sunbeam through the woodland shadows, and a
humming-bird darted in winged beauty from bloom
to bloom. The lark&#8217;s song came vibrating through
the air, and in the more open spaces innumerable birds
flew twittering in the sun. The dewy freshness, the
exquisite softness of spring, was everywhere.</p>
<p>In the golden weather, through shadowed wood and
sunny opening, the war-chief sought his daughter&#8217;s
lodge.</p>
<p>Suddenly a familiar sound attracted his attention,
and he turned toward it. A few steps, and he came
to the margin of a small lake. Several snow-white
swans were floating on it; and near the edge of the
water, but concealed from the swans by the tall reeds
that grew along the shore, was his daughter, watching
them.</p>
<p>She was attired in a simple dress of some oriental
fabric. Her form was small and delicately moulded;
her long black hair fell in rich masses about her
shoulders; and her profile, turned toward him, was
sweetly feminine. The Indian type showed plainly,
but was softened with her mother&#8217;s grace. Her face
was sad, with large appealing eyes and mournful lips,
and full of haunting loveliness; a face whose strange
mournfulness was deepened by the splendor of its
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_78' name='page_78'></a>78</span>
beauty; a face the like of which is rarely seen, but
once seen can never be forgotten.</p>
<p>There was something despondent even in her pose,
as she sat with her shoulders drooping slightly forward
and her dark eyes fixed absently on the swans,
watching them through the bending reeds. Now one
uttered its note, and she listened, seeming to vibrate
to the deep, plaintive cry; then she raised to her
lips a flute that she held in her hands, and answered it
with a perfect intonation,&mdash;an intonation that breathed
the very spirit of the swan. So successful was the
mimicry that the swans replied, thinking it the cry
of a hidden mate; and again she softly, rhythmically
responded.</p>
<p>&#8220;Wallulah!&#8221; said the chief.</p>
<p>She sprang to her feet and turned toward him.
Her dark face lighted with an expressive flash, her
black eyes shone, her features glowed with joy and
surprise. It was like the breaking forth of an inner
illumination. There was now nothing of the Indian
in her face.</p>
<p>&#8220;My father!&#8221; she exclaimed, springing to him and
kissing his hand, greeting him as her mother had
taught her to do from childhood. &#8220;Welcome! Were
you searching for me?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, you were well hidden, but Multnomah is a
good hunter and can always track the fawn to its
covert,&#8221; replied the chief, with the faint semblance
of a smile. All that there was of gentleness
in his nature came out when talking with his
daughter.</p>
<p>&#8220;You have come from the council? Are you not
weary and hungry? Come to the lodge, and let Wallulah
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_79' name='page_79'></a>79</span>
give you food, and spread a mat for you to rest
upon.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, I am hungry only to see Wallulah and hear
her talk. Sit down on the log again.&#8221; She seated
herself, and her father stood beside her with an abstracted
gaze, his hand stroking her long, soft tresses.
He was thinking of the darker, richer tresses of another,
whose proud, sad face and mournful eyes with their
wistful meaning, so like Wallulah&#8217;s own, he, a barbarian
prince, could never understand.</p>
<p>Although, according to the superstitious custom of
the Willamettes, he never spoke the name of Sea-Flower
or alluded to her in any way, he loved his
lost wife with a deep and unchanging affection. She
had been a fair frail thing whose grace and refinement
perplexed and fascinated him, moving him to
unwonted tenderness and yearning. He had brought
to her the spoils of the chase and of battle. The
finest mat was braided for her lodge, the choicest
skins and furs spread for her bed, and the chieftainess&#8217;s
string of <i>hiagua</i> shells and grizzly bear&#8217;s claws
had been put around her white neck by Multnomah&#8217;s
own hand. In spite of all this, she drooped and
saddened year by year; the very hands that sought
to cherish her seemed but to bruise; and she sickened
and died, the delicate woman, in the arms of
the iron war-chief, like a flower in the grasp of a
mailed hand.</p>
<p>Why did she die? Why did she always seem so
sad? Why did she so often steal away to weep over
her child? Was not the best food hers, and the
warm place by the lodge fire, and the softest bearskin
to rest on; and was she not the wife of Multnomah,&mdash;the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_80' name='page_80'></a>80</span>
big chief&#8217;s woman? Why then should
she droop and die like a winged bird that one tries
to tame by tying it to the wigwam stake and tossing
it food?</p>
<p>Often the old chief brooded over these questions,
but it was unknown to all, even to Wallulah. Only
his raven tresses, cut close year by year in sign of
perpetual mourning, told that he had not forgotten,
could never forget.</p>
<p>The swans had taken flight, and their long lingering
note sounded faint in the distance.</p>
<p>&#8220;You have frightened away my swans,&#8221; said Wallulah,
looking up at him smilingly.</p>
<p>A shadow crossed his brow.</p>
<p>&#8220;Wallulah,&#8221; he said, and his voice had now the
stern ring habitual to it, &#8220;you waste your life with
the birds and trees and that thing of sweet sounds,&#8221;&mdash;pointing
to the flute. &#8220;Better be learning to think
on the things a war-chief&#8217;s daughter should care for,&mdash;the
feast and the council, the war-parties and the
welcome to the braves when they come back to the
camp with the spoil.&#8221;</p>
<p>The bright look died out of her face.</p>
<p>&#8220;You say those words so often,&#8221; she replied sorrowfully,
&#8220;and I try to obey, but cannot. War is
terrible to me.&#8221;</p>
<p>His countenance grew harsher, his hand ceased to
stroke her hair.</p>
<p>&#8220;And has Multnomah, chief of the Willamettes
and war-chief of the Wauna, lived to hear his daughter
say that war is terrible to her? Have you nothing
of your father in you? Remember the tales of
the brave women of Multnomah&#8217;s race,&mdash;the women
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_81' name='page_81'></a>81</span>
whose blood is in your veins. Remember that they
spoke burning words in the council, and went forth
with the men to battle, and came back with their own
garments stained with blood. You shudder! Is it
at the thought of blood?&#8221;</p>
<p>The old wistful look came back, the old sadness
was on the beautiful face again. One could see now
why it was there.</p>
<p>&#8220;My father,&#8221; she said sorrowfully, &#8220;Wallulah has
tried to love those things, but she cannot. She cannot
change the heart the Great Spirit has given her.
She cannot bring herself to be a woman of battle any
more than she can sound a war-cry on her flute,&#8221; and
she lifted it as she spoke.</p>
<p>He took it into his own hands.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is this,&#8221; he said, breaking down the sensitive
girl in the same despotic way in which he bent the
wills of warriors; &#8220;it is this that makes you weak.
Is it a charm that draws the life from your heart? If
so, it can be broken.&#8221;</p>
<p>Another moment and the flute would have been
broken in his ruthless hands and its fragments flung
into the lake; but Wallulah, startled, caught it from
him with a plaintive cry.</p>
<p>&#8220;It was my mother&#8217;s. If you break it you will
break my heart!&#8221;</p>
<p>The chief&#8217;s angry features quivered at the mention
of her mother, and he instantly released the flute.
Wallulah clasped it to her bosom as if it represented
in some way the mother she had lost, and her eyes
filled with tears. Again her father&#8217;s hand rested on
her head, and she knew that he too was thinking of
her mother. Her nature rose up in revolt against the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_82' name='page_82'></a>82</span>
Indian custom which forbade talking of the dead.
Oh, if she might only talk with her father about her
mother, though it were but a few brief words! Never
since her mother&#8217;s death had her name been mentioned
between them. She lifted her eyes, pathetic
with three years&#8217; hunger, to his. As their glances
met, it seemed as if the veil that had been between
their diverse natures was for a moment lifted, and
they understood each other better than they ever had
before. While his look imposed silence and sealed
her lips as with a spoken command, there was a gleam
of tenderness in it that said, &#8220;I understand, I too
remember; but it must not be spoken.&#8221;</p>
<p>There came to her a sense of getting closer to her
father&#8217;s heart, even while his eyes held her back and
bade her be silent.</p>
<p>At length the chief spoke, this time very gently.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now I shall talk to you not as to a girl but as to
a woman. You are Multnomah&#8217;s only child. When
he dies there will be no one but you to take his place.
Are your shoulders strong enough to bear the weight
of power, the weight that crushes men? Can you
break down revolt and read the hearts of plotters,&mdash;yes,
and detect conspiracy when it is but a whisper
in the air? Can you sway council and battle to your
will as the warrior bends his bow? No; it takes
men, men strong of heart, to rule the races of the
Wauna. Therefore there is but one way left me
whereby the line of Multnomah may still be head of
the confederacy when he is gone. I must wed you
to a great warrior who can take my place when I am
dead and shelter you with his strength. Then the
name and the power of Multnomah will still live
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_83' name='page_83'></a>83</span>
among the tribes, though Multnomah himself be
crumbled into dust.&#8221;</p>
<p>She made no reply, but sat looking confused and
pained, by no means elated at the future he had
described.</p>
<p>&#8220;Have you never thought of this,&mdash;that some time
I must give you to a warrior?&#8221;</p>
<p>Her head drooped lower and her cheek faintly
flushed.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sometimes.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But you have chosen no one?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I do not know,&#8221; she faltered.</p>
<p>Her father&#8217;s hand still rested on her head,
but there was an expression on his face that showed
he would not hesitate to sacrifice her happiness to
his ambition.</p>
<p>&#8220;You have chosen, then? Is he a chief? No, I
will not ask that; the daughter of Multnomah could
love no one but a chief. I have already selected a
husband for you. Tear this other love from your
heart and cast it aside.&#8221;</p>
<p>The flush died out of her cheek, leaving it cold and
ashen; and her fingers worked nervously with the
flute in her lap.</p>
<p>He continued coldly,&mdash;</p>
<p>&#8220;The fame of your beauty has gone out through
all the land. The chief of the Chopponish<a name='FNanchor_0002' id='FNanchor_0002'></a><a href='#Footnote_0002' class='fnanchor'>[2]</a> has offered
many horses for you, and the chief of the Spokanes,
our ancient foes, has said there would be peace between
us if I gave you to him. But I have promised
you to another. Your marriage to him will knit the
bravest tribe of the confederacy to us; he will take
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_84' name='page_84'></a>84</span>
my place when I am dead, and our people will still
be strong.&#8221;</p>
<p>She made no reply. What could she do against
her father&#8217;s granite will? All the grace and mobility
were gone from her face, and it was drooping and
dull almost to impassiveness. She was only an Indian
girl now, waiting to learn the name of him who
was to be her master.</p>
<p>&#8220;What is the name of the one you love? Speak
it once, then never speak it again.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Snoqualmie, chief of the Cayuses,&#8221; faltered her
tremulous lips.</p>
<p>A quick change of expression came into the gaze
that was bent on her.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now lift your head and meet your fate like
the daughter of a chief. Do not let me see
your face change while I tell you whom I have
chosen.&#8221;</p>
<p>She lifted her face in a tumult of fear and dread,
and her eyes fastened pathetically on the chief.</p>
<p>&#8220;His name is&mdash;&#8221; she clasped her hands and her
whole soul went out to her father in the mute supplication
of her gaze&mdash;&#8220;the chief Snoqualmie, him of
whom you have thought.&#8221;</p>
<p>Her face was bewilderment itself for an instant;
the next, the sudden light, the quick flash of expression
which transfigured it in a moment of joy or surprise,
came to her, and she raised his hand and kissed
it. Was that all? Remember she had in her the deep,
mute Indian nature that meets joy or anguish alike in
silence. She had early learned to repress and control
her emotions. Perhaps that was why she was so sad
and brooding now.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_85' name='page_85'></a>85</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Where have you seen Snoqualmie?&#8221; asked Multnomah.
&#8220;Not in your father&#8217;s lodge, surely, for when
strange chiefs came to him you always fled like a
frightened bird.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Once only have I seen him,&#8221; she replied, flushing
and confused. &#8220;He had come here alone to tell you
that some of the tribes were plotting against you. I
saw him as he went back through the wood to the
place where his canoe was drawn up on the bank of
the river. He was tall; his black hair fell below his
shoulders; and his look was very proud and strong.
His back was to the setting sun, and it shone around
him robing him with fire, and I thought he looked
like the Indian sun-god.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I am glad it is pleasant for you to obey me. Now,
listen while I tell you what you must do as the wife
of Snoqualmie.&#8221;</p>
<p>Stilling the sweet tumult in her breast, she tried hard
to listen while he told her of the plans, the treaties,
the friendships, and the enmities she must urge on
her husband, when he became war-chief and was carrying
on her father&#8217;s work; and in part she understood,
for her imagination was captivated by the
splendid though barbarian dream of empire he set
before her.</p>
<p>At length, as the sun was setting, one came to tell
Multnomah that a runner from a tribe beyond the
mountains had come to see him. Then her father
left her; but Wallulah still sat on the mossy log, while
all the woodland was golden in the glory of sunset.</p>
<p>Her beloved flute was pressed close to her cheek,
and her face was bright and joyous; she was thinking
of Snoqualmie, the handsome stately chief whom
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_86' name='page_86'></a>86</span>
she had seen but once, but whose appearance, as she
saw him then, had filled her girlish heart.</p>
<p>And all the time she knew not that this Snoqualmie,
to whom she was to be given, was one of the
most cruel and inhuman of men, terrible even to
the grim warriors of the Wauna for his deeds of
blood.</p>

Shipwrecks of Asiatic vessels are not uncommon on the Pacific
Coast, several having occurred during the present century,&mdash;notably
that of a Japanese junk in 1833, from which three passengers were saved at the hands of the Indians; while the cases of beeswax that
have been disinterred on the sea-coast, the oriental words that are found
ingrafted in the native languages, and the Asiatic type of countenance
shown by many of the natives, prove such wrecks to have been frequent
in prehistoric times. One of the most romantic stories of the Oregon
coast is that which the Indians tell of a buried treasure at Mount Nehalem,
left there generations ago by shipwrecked men of strange garb
and curious arms,&mdash;treasure which, like that of Captain Kidd, has been
often sought but never found. There is also an Indian legend of a shipwrecked
white man named Soto, and his comrades (See Mrs. Victor&#8217;s
&#8220;Oregon and Washington&#8221;), who lived long with the mid-Columbia
Indians and then left them to seek some settlement of their own people
in the south. All of these legends point to the not infrequent occurrence
of such a wreck as our story describes.

<p>At early morning, the sachems had gathered in the
council-grove, Multnomah on the seat of the
war-chief, and twenty runners before him. They
were the flower of the Willamette youth, every one
of royal birth, handsome in shape and limb, fleet-footed
as the deer. They were slender and sinewy
in build, with aquiline features and sharp searching
eyes.</p>
<p>Their garb was light. Leggins and moccasins had
been laid aside; even the <i>hiagua</i> shells were stripped
from their ears. All stood nerved and eager for the
race, waiting for the word that was to scatter them
throughout the Indian empire, living thunderbolts
bearing the summons of Multnomah.</p>
<p>The message had been given them, and they waited
only to pledge themselves to its faithful delivery.</p>
<p>&#8220;You promise,&#8221; said the chief, while his flashing
glance read every messenger to the heart, &#8220;you
promise that neither cougar nor cataract nor ambuscade
shall deter you from the delivery of this summons;
that you will not turn back, though the spears
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_88' name='page_88'></a>88</span>
of the enemy are thicker in your path than ferns
along the Santiam? You promise that though you fall
in death, the summons shall go on?&#8221;</p>
<p>The spokesman of the runners, the runner to the
Chopponish, stepped forward. With gestures of perfect
grace, and in a voice that rang like a silver
trumpet, he repeated the ancient oath of the Willamettes,&mdash;the
oath used by the Shoshones to-day.</p>
<p>&#8220;The earth hears us, the sun sees us. Shall we
fail in fidelity to our chief?&#8221;</p>
<p>There was a pause. The distant cry of swans
came from the river; the great trees of council rustled
in the breeze. Multnomah rose from his seat,
gripping the bow on which he leaned. Into that
one moment he seemed gathering yet repressing all
the fierceness of his passion, all the grandeur of his
will. Far in the shade he saw Tohomish raise his
hand imploringly, but the eyes of the orator sank
once more under the glance of the war-chief.</p>
<p>&#8220;Go!&#8221;</p>
<p>An electric shock passed through all who heard;
and except for the chiefs standing on its outskirts
like sombre shadows, the grove was empty in a
moment.</p>
<p>Beyond the waters that girdled the island, one
runner took the trail to Puyallup, one the trail to
Umatilla, one the path to Chelon, and one the path
to Shasta; another departed toward the volcano-rent
desert of Klamath, and still another toward the sea-washed
shores of Puget Sound.</p>
<p>The irrevocable summons had gone forth; the
council was inevitable,&mdash;the crisis must come.</p>

<p>Long did Multnomah and his chiefs sit in council
that day. Resolute were the speeches that came
from all, though many secretly regretted that they
had allowed Multnomah&#8217;s oratory to persuade them
into declaring for the council: but there was no
retreat.</p>
<p>Across hills and canyons sped the fleet runners, on
to the huge bark lodges of Puget Sound, the fisheries
of the Columbia, and the crowded race-courses of the
Yakima. Into camps of wandering prairie tribes,
where the lodges stood like a city to-day and were
rolled up and strapped on the backs of horses to-morrow;
into councils where sinister chiefs were talking
low of war against the Willamettes; into wild
midnight dances of plotting dreamers and medicine-men,&mdash;they
came with the brief stern summons, and
passed on to speak it to the tribes beyond.</p>

<p>It is the day after the departure of the runners to
call the great council,&mdash;eight years since Cecil
Grey went out into the wilderness. Smoke is curling
slowly upward from an Indian camp on the prairie
not far from the Blue Mountains of eastern Oregon.
Fifteen or twenty cone-shaped lodges, each made of
mats stretched on a frame-work of poles, compose
the village. It swarms with wolfish-looking dogs and
dirty, unclad children. Heaps of refuse, heads and
feet of game, lie decaying among the wigwams, tainting
the air with their disgusting odor. Here and
there an ancient withered specimen of humanity sits
in the sun, absorbing its rays with a dull animal-like
sense of enjoyment, and a group of warriors lie idly
talking. Some of the squaws are preparing food,
boiling it in water-tight willow baskets by filling them
with water and putting in hot stones.<a name='FNanchor_0003' id='FNanchor_0003'></a><a href='#Footnote_0003' class='fnanchor'>[3]</a> Horses are
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_92' name='page_92'></a>92</span>
tethered near the lodges, and others are running loose
on the prairie.</p>
<p>There are not many of them. The Indians have
only scores now where a century later Lewis and
Clark found thousands; and there are old men in
the camp who can recall the time when the first
horses ever seen among them were bought or stolen
from the tribes to the south.</p>
<p>On every side the prairie sweeps away in long
grassy swells and hollows, rolling off to the base of
the Blue Mountains.</p>
<p>The camp has the sluggish aspect that an Indian
camp always presents at noonday.</p>
<p>Suddenly a keen-sighted warrior points to a dim
speck far over the prairie toward the land of the
Bannocks. A white man would have scarcely noticed
it; or if he had, would have thought it only some
wandering deer or antelope. But the Indians, glancing
at the moving object, have already recognized it
as a horseman coming straight toward the camp.</p>
<p>Some messenger it is, doubtless, from the Bannocks.
Once the whole camp would have rushed to arms at
the approach of a rider from that direction, for the
two tribes had been at bitter enmity; but of late the
peace-pipe has been smoked between them, and
the old feud is at an end. Still, the sight arouses
considerable curiosity and much speculation as to the
object of the visitor.</p>
<p>He is a good rider, his horse is fleet, and in less
time than would have been thought possible reaches
the camp. He gallops up, stops near the lodges that
are farthest out, and springs lightly to the ground.
He does not go on into the camp, but stands beside
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_93' name='page_93'></a>93</span>
his horse till advances are made on the other
side.</p>
<p>The dogs bark at him; his steed, a fiery black,
tosses its head and paws the ground; he stands beside
it immovably, and to all appearance is ready so to
stand till sunset. Some of the warriors recognize him
as one of the bravest of the Bannocks. He looks like
a daring, resolute man, yet wary and self-contained.</p>
<p>After a while one of the Cayuse warriors (for this
was a camp of the Cayuses) advanced toward him,
and a grave salutation was exchanged. Then the
Bannock said that he wanted to see the Cayuse chief,
Snoqualmie, in the council-lodge, for the chief of the
Bannocks had sent a &#8220;talk&#8221; to the Cayuses.</p>
<p>The warrior left him to speak with Snoqualmie. In
a short time he returned, saying that the chief and
the warriors had gone to the council-lodge and were
ready to hear the &#8220;talk&#8221; that their brother, the chief
of the Bannocks, had sent them. The messenger
tied his horse by its lariat, or long hair-rope, to a
bush, and followed the brave to the lodge.</p>
<p>It was a large wigwam in the centre of the village.
A crowd of old men, women, and children had already
gathered around the door. Within, on one
side of the room, sat in three rows a semi-circle of
braves, facing the chief, who sat on the opposite side.
Near the door was a clear space where the messenger
was to stand while speaking.</p>
<p>He entered, and the doorway behind him was immediately
blocked up by the motley crowd excluded
from the interior. Not a warrior in the council looked
at him; even the chief, Snoqualmie, did not turn his
head. The messenger advanced a few paces into the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_94' name='page_94'></a>94</span>
room, stopped, and stood as impassive as the rest.
Then, when the demands of Indian stoicism had been
satisfied, Snoqualmie turned his face, a handsome but
treacherous and cruel face, upon the messenger.</p>
<p>&#8220;The warrior comes to speak the words of our
brother, the chief of the Bannocks; he is welcome.
Shall we smoke the pipe of peace before we hear our
brother&#8217;s words?&#8221;</p>
<p>The Bannock gazed steadily at Snoqualmie. In
that fierce and proud regard was something the
Cayuse could not fathom.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why should the peace-pipe be smoked?&#8221; he
asked. &#8220;Was it not smoked in the great council a
moon ago? Did not Snoqualmie say then that the
two tribes should henceforth be as one tribe, and that
the Bannocks should be the brethren of the Cayuses
forever?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Those were the words,&#8221; replied the chief with
dignity. &#8220;Snoqualmie has not forgotten them.&#8221;</p>
<p>All eyes were now turned on the messenger; they
saw that something unexpected was coming. The
Bannock drew his form up to its full height, and his
resolute features expressed the bitterest scorn.</p>
<p>&#8220;Nor have the Bannocks forgotten. At the council
you talked &#8216;peace, peace.&#8217; Last night some of your
young men surprised a little camp of Bannocks,&mdash;a
few old men and boys who were watching horses,&mdash;and
slew them and ran off the horses. Is that your
peace? The Bannocks will have no such peace. <i>This</i>
is the word the chief of the Bannocks sends you!&#8221;</p>
<p>Holding up the peace-pipe that had been smoked
at the great council and afterward given to the medicine-men
of the Bannocks as a pledge of Cayuse sincerity,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_95' name='page_95'></a>95</span>
he broke the long slender stem twice, thrice,
crushed the bowl in his fingers, and dashed the pieces
at Snoqualmie&#8217;s feet. It was a defiance, a contemptuous
rejection of peace, a declaration of war more
disdainful than any words could have made it.</p>
<p>Then, before they could recover from their astonishment,
the Bannock turned and leaped through the
crowd at the door,&mdash;for an instant&#8217;s stay was death.
Even as he leaped, Snoqualmie&#8217;s tomahawk whizzed
after him, and a dozen warriors were on their feet,
weapon in hand. But the swift, wild drama had been
played like lightning, and he was gone. Only, a
brave who had tried to intercept his passage lay on
the ground outside the lodge, stabbed to the heart.
They rushed to the door in time to see him throw
himself on his horse and dash off, looking back to
give a yell of triumph and defiance.</p>
<p>In less time than it takes to describe it, the horses
tethered near the lodges were mounted and twenty
riders were in pursuit. But the Bannock was considerably
in advance now, and the fine black horse
he rode held its own nobly. Out over the prairie
flew the pursuing Cayuses, yelling like demons, the
fugitive turning now and then to utter a shout of
derision.</p>
<p>Back at the lodges, the crowd of spectators looked
on with excited comments.</p>
<p>&#8220;His horse is tired, ours are fresh!&#8221; &#8220;They gain
on him!&#8221; &#8220;No, he is getting farther from them!&#8221;
&#8220;See, he throws away his blanket!&#8221; &#8220;They are
closer, closer!&#8221; &#8220;No, no, his horse goes like a deer.&#8221;</p>
<p>Out over the prairies, fleeting like the shadow of a
hurrying cloud, passed the race, the black horse
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_96' name='page_96'></a>96</span>
leading, the Cayuse riders close behind, their long
hair outstreaming, their moccasins pressed against
their horses&#8217; sides, their whips falling without mercy.
Down a canyon they swept in pursuit and passed from
the ken of the watchers at the camp, the black horse
still in the van.</p>
<p>But it could not cope with the fresh horses of the
Cayuses, and they gained steadily. At last the pursuers
came within bowshot, but they did not shoot;
the fugitive knew too well the reason why. Woe unto
him if he fell alive into their hands! He leaned low
along his horse&#8217;s neck, chanting a weird refrain as if
charming it to its utmost speed, and ever and anon
looked back with that heart-shaking shout of defiance.
But steadily his pursuers gained on him; and one,
outstripping the rest, rode alongside and reached out
to seize his rein. Even as he touched it, the Bannock&#8217;s
war-club swung in air and the Cayuse reeled
dead from his saddle. A howl of rage burst from the
others, a whoop of exultation from the fugitive.</p>
<p>But at length his horse&#8217;s breath grew short and
broken, he felt its body tremble as it ran, and his
enemies closed in around him.</p>
<p>Thrice the war-club rose and fell, thrice was a
saddle emptied; but all in vain. Quickly his horse
was caught, he was dragged from the saddle and
bound hand and foot.</p>
<p>He was thrown across a horse and brought back to
the village. What a chorus of triumph went up from
the camp, when it was seen that they were bringing
him back! It was an ominous sound, with something
of wolfish ferocity in it. But the Bannock only smiled
grimly.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_97' name='page_97'></a>97</span></div>
<p>He is bound to a post,&mdash;a charred, bloodstained
post to which others of his race have been bound
before him. The women and children taunt him,
jeer at him, strike him even. The warriors do not.
They will presently do more than that. Some busy
themselves building a fire near by; others bring
pieces of flint, spear points, jagged fragments of rock,
and heat them in it. The prisoner, dusty, torn,
parched with thirst, and bleeding from many wounds,
looks on with perfect indifference. Snoqualmie comes
and gazes at him; the prisoner does not notice him,
is seemingly unconscious of his presence.</p>
<p>By and by a band of hunters ride up from a long
excursion. They have heard nothing of the trouble.
With them is a young Bannock who is visiting the
tribe. He rides up with his Cayuse comrades, laughing,
gesticulating in a lively way. The jest dies on
his lips when he recognizes the Bannock who is tied
to the stake. Before he can even think of flight, he
is dragged from his horse and bound,&mdash;his whilom
comrades, as soon as they understand the situation,
becoming his bitterest assailants.</p>
<p>For it is war again, war to the death between the
tribes, until, two centuries later, both shall alike be
crushed by the white man.</p>
<p>At length the preparations are complete, and the
women and children, who have been swarming around
and taunting the captives, are brushed aside like so
many flies by the stern warriors. First, the young
Bannock who has just come in is put where he must
have a full view of the other. Neither speaks, but
a glance passes between them that is like a mutual
charge to die bravely. Snoqualmie comes and stands
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_98' name='page_98'></a>98</span>
close by the prisoner and gives directions for the
torture to begin.</p>
<p>The Bannock is stripped. The stone blades that
have been in the fire are brought, all red and glowing
with heat, and pressed against his bare flesh. It
burns and hisses under the fiery torture, but the
warrior only sneers.</p>
<p>&#8220;It doesn&#8217;t hurt; you can&#8217;t hurt me. You are
fools. You don&#8217;t know how to torture.&#8221;<a name='FNanchor_0004' id='FNanchor_0004'></a><a href='#Footnote_0004' class='fnanchor'>[4]</a></p>
<p>No refinement of cruelty could wring a complaint
from him. It was in vain that they burned him, cut
the flesh from his fingers, branded his cheek with the
heated bowl of the pipe he had broken.</p>
<p>&#8220;Try it again,&#8221; he said mockingly, while his flesh
smoked. &#8220;I feel no pain. We torture your people
a great deal better, for we make them cry out like
little children.&#8221;</p>
<p>More and more murderous and terrible grew the
wrath of his tormentors, as this stream of vituperation
fell on their ears. Again and again weapons were
lifted to slay him, but Snoqualmie put them back.</p>
<p>&#8220;He can suffer more yet,&#8221; he said; and the words
were like a glimpse into the cold, merciless heart of
the man. Other and fiercer tortures were devised by
the chief, who stood over him, pointing out where and
how the keenest pain could be given, the bitterest
pang inflicted on that burned and broken body.
At last it seemed no longer a man, but a bleeding,
scorched, mutilated mass of flesh that hung to the
stake; only the lips still breathed defiance and the
eyes gleamed deathless hate. Looking upon one and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_99' name='page_99'></a>99</span>
another, he boasted of how he had slain their friends
and relatives. Many of his boasts were undoubtedly
false, but they were very bitter.</p>
<p>&#8220;It was by my arrow that you lost your eye,&#8221; he
said to one; &#8220;I scalped your father,&#8221; to another;
and every taunt provoked counter-taunts accompanied
with blows.</p>
<p>At length he looked at Snoqualmie,&mdash;a look so
ghastly, so disfigured, that it was like something seen
in a horrible dream.</p>
<p>&#8220;I took your sister prisoner last winter; you never
knew,&mdash;you thought she had wandered from home
and was lost in a storm. We put out her eyes, we
tore out her tongue, and then we told her to go out
in the snow and find food. Ah-h-h! you should have
seen her tears as she went out into the storm, and&#8211;&#8211;&#8221;</p>
<p>The sentence was never finished. While the last
word lingered on his lips, his body sunk into a lifeless
heap under a terrific blow, and Snoqualmie put back
his blood-stained tomahawk into his belt.</p>
<p>&#8220;Shall we kill the other?&#8221; demanded the warriors,
gathering around the surviving Bannock, who had
been a stoical spectator of his companion&#8217;s sufferings.
A ferocious clamor from the women and children
hailed the suggestion of new torture; they thronged
around the captive, the children struck him, the women
abused him, spat upon him even, but not a muscle
of his face quivered; he merely looked at them with
stolid indifference.</p>
<p>&#8220;Kill him, kill him!&#8221; &#8220;Stretch him on red hot
stones!&#8221; &#8220;We will make <i>him</i> cry!&#8221;</p>
<p>Snoqualmie hesitated. He wished to save this man
for another purpose, and yet the Indian blood-thirst
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_100' name='page_100'></a>100</span>
was on him; chief and warrior alike were drunken
with fury, mad with the lust of cruelty.</p>
<p>As he hesitated, a white man clad in the garb of
an Indian hunter pushed his way through the crowd.
Silence fell upon the throng; the clamor of the
women, the fierce questioning of the warriors ceased.
The personality of this man was so full of tenderness
and sympathy, so strong and commanding, that it impressed
the most savage nature. Amid the silence, he
came and looked first at the dead body that yet hung
motionless from the stake, then sorrowfully, reproachfully,
at the circle of faces around. An expression
half of sullen shame, half of defiance, crossed more
than one countenance as his glance fell upon it.</p>
<p>&#8220;Friends,&#8221; said he, sadly, pointing at the dead,
&#8220;is this your peace with the Bannocks,&mdash;the peace
you prayed the Great Spirit to bless, the peace that
was to last forever?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The Bannocks sent back the peace-pipe by this
man, and he broke it and cast the pieces in our
teeth,&#8221; answered one, stubbornly.</p>
<p>&#8220;And you slew him for it? Why not have sent
runners to his tribe asking why it was returned, and
demanding to know what wrong you had done, that
you might right it? Now there will be war. When
you lie down to sleep at night, the surprise may be
on you and massacre come while your eyes are heavy
with slumber; when you are gone on the buffalo
trail the tomahawk may fall on the women and children
at home. Death will lurk for you in every thicket
and creep round every encampment. The Great
Spirit is angry because you have stained your hands
in blood without cause.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_101' name='page_101'></a>101</span></div>
<p>There was no reply. This white man, coming
from far eastern lands lying they knew not where,
who told them God had sent him to warn them to be
better, had a singular influence over them. There
was none of his hearers who did not dimly feel that
he had done wrong in burning and scarring the poor
mass of humanity before him, and that the Great
Spirit was angry with him for it.</p>
<p>Back in the crowd, some of the children, young
demons hungering for blood, began to clamor again
for the death of the surviving Bannock. Cecil Grey
looked at him pityingly.</p>
<p>&#8220;At least you can let him go.&#8221;</p>
<p>There was no answer. Better impulses, better desires,
were struggling in their degraded minds; but
cruelty was deeply rooted within them, the vague
shame and misgiving his words had roused was not
so strong as the dark animalism of their natures.</p>
<p>Cecil turned to Snoqualmie.</p>
<p>&#8220;I saved your life once, will you not give me his?&#8221;</p>
<p>The chief regarded him coldly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Take it,&#8221; he said after a pause. Cecil stooped
over and untied the thongs that bound the captive,
who rose to his feet amid a low angry murmur from
those around. Snoqualmie silenced it with an imperious
gesture. Then he turned to the young
Bannock.</p>
<p>&#8220;Dog, one of a race of dogs! go back to your
people and tell them what you have seen to-day. Tell
them how we burned and tortured their messenger,
and that we let you go only to tell the tale. Tell
them, too, that Snoqualmie knows his sister died by
their hand last winter, and that for every hair upon
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_102' name='page_102'></a>102</span>
her head he will burn a Bannock warrior at the stake.
Go, and be quick, lest my war-party overtake you on
the trail.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Bannock left without a word, taking the trail
across the prairie toward the land of his tribe.</p>
<p>&#8220;The gift was given, but there was that given with
it that made it bitter. And now may I bury this
dead body?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It is only a Bannock; who cares what is done
with it?&#8221; replied Snoqualmie. &#8220;But remember, my
debt is paid. Ask of me no more gifts,&#8221; and the
chief turned abruptly away.</p>
<p>&#8220;Who will help me bury this man?&#8221; asked Cecil.
No one replied; and he went alone and cut the
thongs that bound the body to the stake. But as he
stooped to raise it, a tall fine-looking man, a renegade
from the Shoshones, who had taken no part in
the torture, came forward to help him. Together
they bore the corpse away from the camp to the hillside;
together they hollowed out a shallow grave and
stretched the body in it, covering it with earth and
heaping stones on top, that the cayote might not disturb
the last sleep of the dead.</p>
<p>When they returned to the camp, they found a war-party
already in the saddle, with Snoqualmie at their
head, ready to take the Bannock trail. But before
they left the camp, a runner entered it with a summons
from Multnomah calling them to the great
council of the tribes on Wappatto Island, for which
they must start on the morrow.</p>

<p>The camp was all astir at dawn, for sunset must
see them far on the way. They must first cross
the prairies to the northward till they struck the
Columbia, then take the great trail leading down it
to the Willamette valley. It was a two days&#8217; journey
at the least.</p>
<p>Squaws were preparing a hurried meal; lodge-poles
were being taken down and the mats that covered
them rolled up and strapped on the backs of horses;
Indians, yelling and vociferating, were driving up
bands of horses from which pack and riding ponies
were to be selected; unbroken animals were rearing
and plunging beneath their first burdens, while mongrel
curs ran barking at their heels. Here and there
unskilful hands were throwing the lasso amid the jeers
and laughter of the spectators. All was tumult and
excitement.</p>
<p>At length they were under way. First rode the
squaws, driving before them pack-horses and ponies,
for the herds and entire movable property of the
tribe accompanied it in all its marches. The squaws
rode astride, like men, in the rude wooden saddles
that one yet sees used by the wilder Indians of eastern
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_104' name='page_104'></a>104</span>
Oregon and Idaho,&mdash;very high, both before and behind,
looking like exaggerated pack-saddles. A hair
rope, tied around the lower jaw of the horse, answered
for a bridle. To this must be added the quirt, a
short double-lashed whip fastened into a hollow and
curiously carved handle. The application of this
whip was so constant as to keep the right arm in continual
motion; so that even to-day on the frontier an
Indian rider can be distinguished from a white man,
at a distance, by the constant rising and falling of the
whip arm. With the squaws were the children, some
of whom, not over four, five, and six years of age, rode
alone on horseback, tied in the high saddles; managing
their steeds with instinctive skill, and when the
journey became fatiguing, going to sleep, secured by
their fastenings from falling off.</p>
<p>Next came the men, on the best horses, unencumbered
by weight of any kind and armed with bow and
arrow. Here and there a lance pointed with flint, a
stone knife or hatchet, or a heavy war-club, hung at
the saddle; but the bow and arrow constituted their
chief weapon.</p>
<p>The men formed a kind of rear-guard, protecting the
migrating tribe from any sudden assault on the part
of the Bannocks. There were perhaps two hundred
fighting-men in all. Snoqualmie was at their head,
and beside him rode the young Willamette runner
who had brought the summons from Multnomah the
day before. The Willamette was on horseback for
the first time in his life. The inland or prairie tribes
of eastern Oregon, coming as they did in contact with
tribes whose neighbors bordered on Mexico, had
owned horses for perhaps a generation; but the sea-board
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_105' name='page_105'></a>105</span>
tribes owned very few, and there were tribes
on Puget Sound and at the mouth of the Columbia
who had never seen them. Even the Willamettes,
sovereign tribe of the confederacy though they were,
had but few horses.</p>
<p>This morning the young Willamette had bought a
colt, giving for it a whole string of <i>hiagua</i> shells. It
was a pretty, delicate thing, and he was proud of it,
and had shown his pride by slitting its ears and cutting
off its tail, as was the barbarous custom with
many of the Indians. He sat on the little creature
now; and loaded as it was with the double weight of
himself and the heavy wooden saddle, it could hardly
keep pace with the older and stronger horses.</p>
<p>In the rear of all rode Cecil Grey and the Shoshone
renegade who had helped him bury the dead Bannock
the evening before. Cecil&#8217;s form was as slight and
graceful in its Indian garb as in days gone by, and
his face was still the handsome, sensitive face it had
been eight years before. It was stronger now, more
resolute and mature, and from long intercourse with
the Indians there had come into it something grave
and Indian-like; but it only gave more of dignity to his
mien. His brown beard swept his breast, and his face
was bronzed; but the lips quivered under the beard,
and the cheek flushed and paled under the bronze.</p>
<p>What had he been doing in the eight years that
had elapsed since he left his New England home?
Let us listen to his story in his own words as he tells
it to the Shoshone renegade by his side.</p>
<p>&#8220;I lived in a land far to the east, beside a great
water. My people were white like myself. I was
one of an order of men whom the Great Spirit had
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_106' name='page_106'></a>106</span>
appointed to preach of goodness, mercy, and truth,
and to explain to the people the sayings of a mighty
book which he had given to the fathers,&mdash;a book that
told how men should live in this world, and said that
a beautiful place in the next would be given those
who are good and true in this. But by and by the
Great Spirit began to whisper to me of the Indians in
the wilderness who knew nothing of the book or the
hope within it, and a longing rose within me to go
and tell them; but there were ties that held me to
my own people, and I knew not what to do. Death
cut those ties; and in my hour of grief there came
to me a vision of a great bridge far in the west, and
of Indians passing over it, and a voice spoke to me
and bade me go and seek the land of the bridge, for
the Great Spirit had a mission for me there; and I
went forth into the wilderness. I met many tribes
and tarried with them, telling them of God. Many
were evil and treated me harshly, others were kind
and listened. Some loved me and wished me to
abide always in their lodges and be one of them. But
even while they spoke the Great Spirit whispered to
me to go on, and an unrest rose within me, and I
could not stay.</p>
<p>&#8220;So the years went by, and I wandered farther and
farther to the west, across rivers and deserts, till I
reached this tribe; and they said that farther on,
toward the land of the Willamettes, a great river
flowed through the mountains, and across it was a
bridge of stone built by the gods when the world was
young. Then I knew that it was the bridge of my
vision, and the unrest came back and I arose to go.
But the tribe kept me, half as guest and half as prisoner,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_107' name='page_107'></a>107</span>
and would not let me depart; until last night the
runner came summoning them to the council. Now
they go, taking me with them. I shall see the land
of the bridge and perform the work the Great Spirit
has given me to do.&#8221;</p>
<p>The old grand enthusiasm shone in his look as he
closed. The Shoshone regarded him with grave
attention.</p>
<p>&#8220;What became of the book that told of God?&#8221; he
asked earnestly.</p>
<p>&#8220;A chief took it from me and burned it; but its
words were written on my heart, and they could not
be destroyed.&#8221;</p>
<p>They rode on for a time in silence. The way was
rugged, the country a succession of canyons and
ridges covered with green and waving grass but bare
of trees. Behind them, the Blue Mountains were
receding in the distance. To the west, Mt. Hood,
the great white &#8220;Witch Mountain&#8221; of the Indians,
towered over the prairie, streaking the sky with a long
floating wreath of volcanic smoke. Before them,
as they journeyed northward toward the Columbia,
stretched out the endless prairie. Now they descended
into a deep ravine, now they toiled up a
steep hillside. The country literally rolled, undulating
in immense ridges around and over which the long
file of squaws and warriors, herds and pack-horses,
wound like a serpent. From the bands ahead came
shouts and outcries,&mdash;the sounds of rude merriment;
and above all the long-drawn intonation so familiar
to those who have been much with Indian horsemen,&mdash;the
endlessly repeated &#8220;ho-ha, ho-ha, ho-ha,&#8221; a
kind of crude riding-song.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_108' name='page_108'></a>108</span></div>
<p>After a while Cecil said, &#8220;I have told you the story
of my life, will you not tell me the story of yours?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said the renegade, after a moment&#8217;s
thought; &#8220;you have shown me your heart as if you
were my brother. Now I will show you mine.</p>
<p>&#8220;I was a Shoshone warrior.<a name='FNanchor_0005' id='FNanchor_0005'></a><a href='#Footnote_0005' class='fnanchor'>[5]</a> There was a girl in
our village whom I had loved from childhood. We
played together; we talked of how, when I became
a man and a warrior, she should become my wife;
she should keep my wigwam; we would always love
one another. She grew up, and the chief offered many
horses for her. Her father took them. She became
the chief&#8217;s wife, and all my heart withered up. Everything
grew dark. I sat in my wigwam or wandered
in the forest, caring for nothing.</p>
<p>&#8220;When I met her, she turned her face aside, for
was she not the wife of another? Yet I knew her
heart hungered for me. The chief knew it too, and
when he spoke to her a cloud was ever on his brow
and sharp lightning on his tongue. But she was true.
Whose lodge was as clean as his? The wood was
always carried, the water at hand, the meat cooked.
She searched the very thought that was in his heart
to save him the trouble of speaking. He could never
say, &#8216;Why is it not done?&#8217; But her heart was mine,
and he knew it; and he treated her like a dog and not
like a wife.</p>
<p>&#8220;Me too he tried to tread under foot. One day
we assembled to hunt the buffalo. Our horses were
all collected. Mine stood before my tent, and he
came and took them away, saying that they were his.
What could I do? He was a chief.</p>

<p>&#8220;I came no more to the council, I shared no more
in the hunt and the war-dance. I was unhorsed, degraded,
dishonored. He told his wife what he had
done, and when she wept he beat her.</p>
<p>&#8220;One evening I stood on a knoll overlooking the
meadow where the horses were feeding; the chief&#8217;s
horses were there, and mine with them. I saw <i>him</i>
walking among them. The sight maddened me; my
blood burned; I leaped on him; with two blows I laid
him dead at my feet. I covered him with earth and
strewed leaves over the place. Then I went to <i>her</i>
and told her what I had done, and urged her to fly
with me. She answered only with tears. I reminded
her of all she had suffered, and told her I had done
only what was just. I urged her again to fly. She
only wept the more, and bade me go. My heart was
heavy but my eyes were dry.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;It is well,&#8217; I said, &#8216;I will go alone to the desert.
None but the wild beasts of the wilderness will be
with me. The seekers of blood will follow on my
trail; they may come on me while I am asleep and
slay me, but you will be safe. I will go alone.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;I turned to go. She sprang after me. &#8216;No,&#8217; she
cried, &#8216;you shall not go alone. Wherever you go I
will go: you shall never part from me.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;While we were talking, one who had seen me
slay the chief and had roused the camp, came with
others. We heard their steps approaching the door,
and knew that death came with them. We escaped
at the back of the lodge, but they saw us and their
arrows flew. She fell, and I caught her in my arms
and fled into the wood. When we were safe I looked
at her I carried, and she was dead. An arrow had
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_110' name='page_110'></a>110</span>
pierced her heart. I buried her that night beneath
a heap of stones, and fled to the Cayuses. That is my
story.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What will you do now?&#8221; asked Cecil, deeply
touched.</p>
<p>&#8220;I shall live a man&#8217;s life. I shall hunt and go on
the war-trail, and say strong words in the council.
And when my life is ended, when the sunset and the
night come to me and I go forth into the darkness, I
know I shall find her I love waiting for me beside the
death-trail that leads to the spirit-land.&#8221;</p>
<p>The tears came into Cecil&#8217;s eyes.</p>
<p>&#8220;I too have known sorrow,&#8221; he said, &#8220;and like you
I am a wanderer from my own people. We are going
together into an unknown land, knowing not what
may befall us. Let us be friends.&#8221;</p>
<p>And he held out his hand. The Indian took it,&mdash;awkwardly,
as an Indian always takes the hand of a
white man, but warmly, heartily.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are brothers,&#8221; he said simply. And as Cecil
rode on with the wild troop into the unknown world
before him, he felt that there was one beside him who
would be faithful, no matter what befell.</p>
<p>The long day wore on; the sun rose to the zenith
and sunk, and still the Indians pushed forward. It
was a long, forced march, and Cecil was terribly
fatigued when at last one of the Indians told him that
they were near a big river where they would camp for
the night.</p>
<p>&#8220;One sun more,&#8221; said the Indian, pointing to the
sun now sinking in the west, &#8220;and you will see the
Bridge of the Gods.&#8221;</p>
<p>The news re-animated Cecil, and he hurried on. A
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_111' name='page_111'></a>111</span>
shout rose from the Indians in advance. He saw the
head of the long train of horses and riders pause and
look downward and the Indians at the rear gallop forward.
Cecil and his friend followed and joined them.</p>
<p>&#8220;The river! the river!&#8221; cried the Indians, as they
rode up. The scene below was one of gloomy but
magnificent beauty. Beneath them opened an immense
canyon, stupendous even in that land of canyons,&mdash;the
great canyon of the Columbia. The walls
were brown, destitute of verdure, sinking downward
from their feet in yawning precipices or steep slopes.
At the bottom, more than a thousand feet below,
wound a wide blue river, the gathered waters of half
a continent. Beneath them, the river plunged over a
long low precipice with a roar that filled the canyon
for miles. Farther on, the flat banks encroached upon
the stream till it seemed narrowed to a silver thread
among the jutting rocks. Still farther, it widened
again, swept grandly around a bend in the distance,
and passed from sight.</p>
<p>&#8220;<i>Tuum, tuum</i>,&#8221; said the Indians to Cecil, in tones
that imitated the roar of the cataract. It was the
&#8220;Tum&#8221; of Lewis and Clark, the &#8220;Tumwater&#8221; of
more recent times; and the place below, where the
compressed river wound like a silver thread among
the flat black rocks, was the far-famed Dalles of the
Columbia. It was superb, and yet there was something
profoundly lonely and desolate about it,&mdash;the
majestic river flowing on forever among barren rocks
and crags, shut in by mountain and desert, wrapped
in an awful solitude where from age to age scarce
a sound was heard save the cry of wild beasts or
wilder men.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_112' name='page_112'></a>112</span></div>
<p>&#8220;It is the very river of death and of desolation,&#8221;
thought Cecil. &#8220;It looks lonely, forsaken, as if no
eye had beheld it from the day of creation until now.&#8221;</p>
<p>Looking again at the falls, he saw, what he had
not before noticed, a large camp of Indians on the
side nearest them. Glancing across the river, he
descried on a knoll on the opposite bank&mdash;what?
Houses! He could not believe his eyes; could it be
possible? Yes, they certainly were long, low houses,
roofed as the white man roofs his. A sudden wild
hope thrilled him; his brain grew dizzy. He turned
to one of the Indians.</p>
<p>&#8220;Who built those houses?&#8221; he exclaimed; &#8220;white
men like me?&#8221;</p>
<p>The other shook his head.</p>
<p>&#8220;No, Indians.&#8221;</p>
<p>Cecil&#8217;s heart died within him. &#8220;After all,&#8221; he
murmured, &#8220;it was absurd to expect to find a settlement
of white men here. How could I think that
any but Indians had built those houses?&#8221;</p>
<p>Still, as they descended the steep zigzag pathway
leading down to the river, he could not help gazing
again and again at the buildings that so reminded
him of home.</p>
<p>It was Wishram, the ancient village of the falls,
whose brave and insolent inhabitants, more than a century
later, were the dread of the early explorers and
fur traders of the Columbia. It was built at the last
and highest fishery on the Columbia, for the salmon
could not at that time ascend the river above the
falls. All the wandering tribes of the Upper Columbia
came there to fish or to buy salmon of the Wishram
fishers. There too the Indians of the Lower
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_113' name='page_113'></a>113</span>
Columbia and the Willamette met them, and bartered
the <i>hiagua</i> shells, the dried berries, and <i>wappatto</i> of
their country for the bear claws and buffalo robes of
the interior. It was a rendezvous where buying, selling,
gambling, dancing, feasting took the place of war
and the chase; though the ever burning enmities of
the tribes sometimes flamed into deadly feuds and the
fair-ground not infrequently became a field of battle.</p>
<p>The houses of Wishram were built of logs, the walls
low, the lower half being below the surface of the
ground, so that they were virtually half cellar. At
a distance, the log walls and arched roofs gave them
very much the appearance of a frontier town of the
whites.</p>
<p>As they descended to the river-side, Cecil looked
again and again at the village, so different from the
skin or bark lodges of the Rocky Mountain tribes he
had been with so long. But the broad and sweeping
river flowed between, and his gaze told him little
more than his first glance had done.</p>
<p>They were now approaching the camp. Some of
the younger braves at the head of the Cayuse train
dashed toward it, yelling and whooping in the wildest
manner. Through the encampment rang an answering
shout.</p>
<p>&#8220;The Cayuses! the Cayuses! and the white medicine-man!&#8221;</p>
<p>The news spread like wildfire, and men came running
from all directions to greet the latest arrivals.
It was a scene of abject squalor that met Cecil&#8217;s eyes
as he rode with the others into the camp. Never had
he seen among the Indian races aught so degraded as
those Columbia River tribes.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_114' name='page_114'></a>114</span></div>
<p>The air was putrid with decaying fish; the very
skins and mats that covered the lodge-poles were
black with rancid salmon and filth. Many of the men
were nude; most of the women wore only a short
garment of skin or woven cedar bark about the waist,
falling scarcely to the knees. The heads of many had
been artificially flattened; their faces were brutal; their
teeth worn to the gums with eating sanded salmon;
and here and there bleared and unsightly eyes showed
the terrible prevalence of ophthalmia. Salmon were
drying in the sun on platforms raised above the reach
of dogs. Half-starved horses whose raw and bleeding
mouths showed the effect of the hair-rope bridles, and
whose projecting ribs showed their principal nutriment
to be sage-brush and whip-lash, were picketed
among the lodges. Cayote-like dogs and unclad
children, shrill and impish, ran riot, fighting together
for half-dried, half-decayed pieces of salmon. Prevailing
over everything was the stench which is unique
and unparalleled among the stenches of the earth,&mdash;the
stench of an Indian camp at a Columbia fishery.<a name='FNanchor_0006' id='FNanchor_0006'></a><a href='#Footnote_0006' class='fnanchor'>[6]</a></p>
<p>Perhaps ten of the petty inland tribes had assembled
there as their starting-point for the great council
at Wappatto Island. All had heard rumors of
the white man who had appeared among the tribes
to the south saying that the Great Spirit had sent him
to warn the Indians to become better, and all were
anxious to see him. They pointed him out to one
another as he rode up,&mdash;the man of graceful presence
and delicate build; they thronged around him, naked
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_115' name='page_115'></a>115</span>
men and half-clad women, squalid, fierce as wild
beasts, and gazed wonderingly.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is he, the white man,&#8221; they whispered among
themselves. &#8220;See the long beard.&#8221; &#8220;See the white
hands.&#8221; &#8220;Stand back, the Great Spirit sent him; he
is strong <i>tomanowos</i>; beware his anger.&#8221;</p>
<p>Now the horses were unpacked and the lodges
pitched, under the eyes of the larger part of the
encampment, who watched everything with insatiable
curiosity, and stole all that they could lay their hands
on. Especially did they hang on every motion of
Cecil; and he sank very much in their estimation
when they found that he helped his servant, the old
Indian woman, put up his lodge.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ugh, he does squaw&#8217;s work,&#8221; was the ungracious
comment. After awhile, when the lodge was up and
Cecil lay weary and exhausted upon his mat within it,
a messenger entered and told him that the Indians
were all collected near the river bank and wished him
to come and give them the &#8220;talk&#8221; he had brought
from the Great Spirit.</p>
<p>Worn as he was, Cecil arose and went. It was in
the interval between sunset and dark. The sun still
shone on the cliffs above the great canyon, but in the
spaces below the shadows were deepening. On the
flat rocks near the bank of the river, and close by
the falls of Tumwater, the Indians were gathered to
the number of several hundred, awaiting him,&mdash;some
squatting, Indian fashion, on the ground, others
standing upright, looking taller than human in the
dusky light. Mingled with the debased tribes that
made up the larger part of the gathering, Cecil saw
here and there warriors of a bolder and superior race,&mdash;Yakimas
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_116' name='page_116'></a>116</span>
and Klickitats, clad in skins or wrapped
in blankets woven of the wool of the mountain sheep.</p>
<p>Cecil stood before them and spoke, using the Willamette
tongue, the language of common intercourse
between the tribes, all of whom had different dialects.
The audience listened in silence while he told them
of the goodness and compassion of the Great Spirit;
how it grieved him to see his children at war among
themselves, and how he, Cecil, had been sent to warn
them to forsake their sins and live better lives. Long
familiarity with the Indians had imparted to him
somewhat of their manner of thinking and speaking;
his language had become picturesque with Indian imagery,
and his style of oratory had acquired a tinge
of Indian gravity. But the intense and vivid spirituality
that had ever been the charm of his eloquence
was in it still. There was something in his words
that for the moment, and unconsciously to them, lifted
his hearers to a higher plane. When he closed there
was upon them that vague remorse, that dim desire
to be better, that indefinable wistfulness, which his
earnest, tender words never failed to arouse in his
hearers.</p>
<p>When he lifted his hands at the close of his &#8220;talk,&#8221;
and prayed that the Great Spirit might pity them, that
he might take away from them the black and wicked
heart of war and hate and give them the new heart
of peace and love, the silence was almost breathless,
broken only by the unceasing roar of the falls and the
solemn pleading of the missionary&#8217;s voice.</p>
<p>He left them and returned through the deepening
shadows to his lodge. There he flung himself on the
couch of furs the old Indian woman had spread for
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_117' name='page_117'></a>117</span>
him. Fatigued with the long ride of the day and the
heavy draught his address had made on an overtaxed
frame, he tried to sleep.</p>
<p>But he could not. The buildings of the town of
Wishram across the river, so like the buildings of the
white man, had awakened a thousand memories of
home. Vivid pictures of his life in New England
and in the cloisters of Magdalen came before his
sleepless eyes. The longing for the refined and
pleasant things that had filled his life rose strong and
irrepressible within him. Such thoughts were never
entirely absent from his mind, but at times they seemed
to dominate him completely, driving him into a perfect
fever of unrest and discontent. After tossing
for hours on his couch, he arose and went out into
the open air.</p>
<p>The stars were bright; the moon flooded the wide
canyon with lustre; the towering walls rose dim and
shadowy on either side of the river whose waters
gleamed white in the moonlight; the solemn roar of
the falls filled the silence of the night.</p>
<p>Around him was the barbarian encampment, with
here and there a fire burning and a group of warriors
talking beside it. He walked forth among the lodges.
Some were silent, save for the heavy breathing of the
sleepers; others were lighted up within, and he could
hear the murmur of voices.</p>
<p>At one place he found around a large fire a crowd
who were feasting, late as was the hour, and boasting
of their exploits. He stood in the shadow a moment
and listened. One of them concluded his tale by
springing to his feet, advancing a few paces from the
circle of firelight, and making a fierce speech to invisible
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_118' name='page_118'></a>118</span>
foes. Looking toward the land of the Shoshones,
he denounced them with the utmost fury, dared them
to face him, scorned them because they did not appear,
and ended by shaking his tomahawk in their direction,
amid the applause of his comrades.</p>
<p>Cecil passed on and reached the outer limit of the
camp. There, amid some large bowlders, he almost
stumbled on a band of Indians engaged in some grisly
ceremony. He saw them, however, in time to escape
observation and screen himself behind one of the
rocks.</p>
<p>One of the Indians held a rattlesnake pinned to
the ground with a forked stick. Another held out a
piece of liver to the snake and was provoking him to
bite it. Again and again the snake, quivering with
fury and rattling savagely, plunged his fangs into the
liver. Several Indians stood looking on, with arrows
in their hands. At length, when the meat was thoroughly
impregnated with the virus, the snake was
released and allowed to crawl away. Then they all
dipped the points of their arrows in the poisoned
liver,<a name='FNanchor_0007' id='FNanchor_0007'></a><a href='#Footnote_0007' class='fnanchor'>[7]</a> carefully marking the shaft of each in order to
distinguish it from those not poisoned. None of them
saw Cecil, and he left without being discovered.</p>
<p>Why did they wish to go to the council with
poisoned arrows?</p>
<p>Further on, among the rocks and remote from the
camp, he saw a great light and heard a loud hallooing.
He went cautiously toward it. He found a large fire
in an open space, and perhaps thirty savages, stripped
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_119' name='page_119'></a>119</span>
and painted, dancing around it, brandishing their
weapons and chanting a kind of war-chant. On
every face, as the firelight fell on it, was mad ferocity
and lust of war. Near them lay the freshly killed
body of a horse whose blood they had been drinking.
Drunk with frenzy, drunk with blood, they danced
and whirled in that wild saturnalia till Cecil grew
dizzy with the sight.<a name='FNanchor_0008' id='FNanchor_0008'></a><a href='#Footnote_0008' class='fnanchor'>[8]</a></p>
<p>He made his way back to the camp and sought his
lodge. He heard the wolves howling on the hills, and
a dark presentiment of evil crept over him.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is not to council that these men are going, but
to war,&#8221; he murmured, as he threw himself on his
couch. &#8220;God help me to be faithful, whatever
comes! God help me to keep my life and my words
filled with his spirit, so that these savage men may be
drawn to him and made better, and my mission be
fulfilled! I can never hope to see the face of white
man again, but I can live and die faithful to the last.&#8221;</p>
<p>So thinking, a sweet and restful peace came to him,
and he fell asleep. And even while he thought how
impossible it was for him ever to reach the land of
the white man again, an English exploring-ship lay at
anchor at Yaquina Bay, only two days&#8217; ride distant;
and on it were some who had known and loved him
in times gone by, but who had long since thought
him lost in the wilderness forever.</p>

<p>&#8220;You say that we shall see the Bridge of the Gods
to-day?&#8221; asked Cecil of the young Willamette
runner the next morning. &#8220;Tell me about it; is it
high?&#8221;</p>
<p>The young Willamette rose to his full height, arched
his right hand above his eyes, looked skyward with a
strained expression as if gazing up at an immense
height, and emitted a prolonged &#8220;ah-h-h!&#8221;</p>
<p>That was all, but it was enough to bring the light
to Cecil&#8217;s eyes and a sudden triumphant gladness to
his heart. At last he approached the land of his
vision, at last he should find the bridge whose wraith
had faded before him into the west eight years before!</p>
<p>The Cayuse band had started early that morning.
The chief Snoqualmie was impatient of delay, and
wished to be one of the earliest at the council; he
wanted to signalize himself in the approaching struggle
by his loyalty to Multnomah, whose daughter he was
to marry and whom he was to succeed as war-chief.</p>
<p>The women were in advance, driving the pack-horses;
Cecil rode behind them with the Shoshone
renegade and the young Willamette runner; while
Snoqualmie brought up the rear, looking sharply after
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_121' name='page_121'></a>121</span>
stragglers,&mdash;for some of his young men were very
much inclined to linger at the rendezvous and indulge
in a little gambling and horse-racing with the other
bands, who were not to start till later in the day.</p>
<p>The young Willamette still rode the pretty little
pony whose ears and tail he had so barbarously mutilated.
It reeled under him from sheer weakness, so
young was it and so worn by the journey of the day
before. In vain did Cecil expostulate. With true
Indian obtuseness and brutality, the Willamette refused
to see why he should be merciful to a horse.</p>
<p>&#8220;Suppose he rode me, what would <i>he</i> care? Now
I ride him, what do I care? Suppose he die, plenty
more <i>hiagua</i> shells, plenty more horses.&#8221;</p>
<p>After which logical answer he plied the whip harder
than ever, making the pony keep up with the stronger
and abler horses of the other riders. The long train of
squaws and warriors wound on down the trail by the
river-side. In a little while Wishram and Tumwater
passed from sight. The wind began to blow; the
ever drifting sand of the Columbia came sifting in
their faces. They passed the Dalles of the Columbia;
and the river that, as seen from the heights the
evening before, wound like a silver thread among the
rocks, was found to be a compressed torrent that
rushed foaming along the narrow passage,&mdash;literally,
as it has been described, &#8220;a river turned on edge.&#8221;</p>
<p>There too they passed the camp of the Wascos,
who were preparing to start, but suspended their
preparations at the approach of the cavalcade and
stood along the path eager to see the white man.
Cecil noticed that as they descended the river the
language of the local tribes became more gutteral, and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_122' name='page_122'></a>122</span>
the custom of flattening the head prevailed more and
more.<a name='FNanchor_0009' id='FNanchor_0009'></a><a href='#Footnote_0009' class='fnanchor'>[9]</a></p>
<p>Below, the scenery was less barren; the river entered
the Cascade Range, and the steep banks, along
which wound the trail, grew dark with pines, relieved
here and there with brighter verdure. They saw
bands of Indians on the opposite shore, descending
the trail along that side on the way to the council.
Many were on foot, though some horses were among
them. They were Indians of the nine tribes of the
Klickitat, and as yet had but few horses. A century
later they owned thousands. Indian women never
accompanied war-parties; and Cecil noticed that some
of the bands were composed entirely of men, which
gave them the appearance of going to war. It had
an ominous and doubtful look.</p>
<p>At the Wau-coma (place of cottonwoods), the
modern Hood River, they found the tribe that inhabited
that beautiful valley already on the march, and
the two bands mingled and went on together. The
Wau-comas seemed to be peaceably inclined, for their
women were with them.</p>
<p>A short distance below the Wau-coma, the young
Willamette&#8217;s horse, urged till it could go no farther,
fell beneath him. The blood gushed from its nostrils;
in a few moments it was dead. The Willamette
extricated himself from it. &#8220;A bad horse, <i>cultus</i>
[no good]!&#8221; he said, beating it with his whip. After
venting his anger on it in that way, he strode forward
on foot.</p>
<p>And now Cecil was all expectation, on the alert
for the first sight of the bridge.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_123' name='page_123'></a>123</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Shall we see it soon?&#8221; he asked the young
Willamette.</p>
<p>&#8220;When the sun is there, we shall see it,&#8221; replied
the Indian, pointing to the zenith. The sun still
lacked several hours of noon, and Cecil had to restrain
his impatience as best he could.</p>
<p>Just then an incident occurred that for the time
effectually obliterated all thought of the bridge, and
made him a powerful enemy where he least desired one.</p>
<p>At a narrow place in the trail, the loose horses that
were being driven at the head of the column became
frightened and ran back upon their drivers. In a
moment, squaws, pack-horses, and ponies were all
mingled together. The squaws tried in vain to restore
order; it seemed as if there was going to be a general
stampede. The men dashed up from the rear, Snoqualmie
and Cecil among them. Cecil&#8217;s old nurse
happened to be in Snoqualmie&#8217;s way. The horse she
rode was slow and obstinate; and when she attempted
to turn aside to let Snoqualmie pass he would not
obey the rein, and the chief&#8217;s way was blocked. To
Snoqualmie an old Indian woman was little more than
a dog, and he raised his whip and struck her across
the face.</p>
<p>Like a flash, Cecil caught the chief&#8217;s rein and lifted
his own whip. An instant more, and the lash would
have fallen across the Indian&#8217;s face; but he remembered
that he was a missionary, that he was violating
his own precepts of forgiveness in the presence of
those whom he hoped to convert.</p>
<p>The blow did not fall; he grappled with his anger
and held it back; but Snoqualmie received from him
a look of scorn so withering, that it seemed when
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_124' name='page_124'></a>124</span>
Cecil&#8217;s flashing eyes met his own as if he had been
struck, and he grasped his tomahawk. Cecil released
the rein and turned away without a word. Snoqualmie
seemed for a moment to deliberate within himself;
then he let go his weapon and passed on. Order
was restored and the march resumed.</p>
<p>&#8220;You are strong,&#8221; said the Shoshone renegade to
Cecil. He had seen the whole of the little drama.
&#8220;You are strong; you held your anger down, but
your eyes struck him as if he were a dog.&#8221;</p>
<p>Cecil made no reply, but rode on thinking that he
had made an enemy. He regretted what had happened;
and yet, when he recalled the insult, his blood
burned and he half regretted that the blow had not
been given. So, absorbed in painful thought, he rode
on, till a murmur passing down the line roused him.</p>
<p>&#8220;The bridge! The bridge!&#8221;</p>
<p>He looked up hastily, his whole frame responding
to the cry. There it was before him, and only a short
distance away,&mdash;a great natural bridge, a rugged ridge
of stone, pierced with a wide arched tunnel through
which the waters flowed, extending across the river.
It was covered with stunted pine and underbrush
growing in every nook and crevice; and on it were
Indian horsemen with plumed hair and rude lances.
It was the bridge of the Wauna, the Bridge of the
Gods, the bridge he had seen in his vision eight years
before.</p>
<p>For a moment his brain reeled, everything seemed
shadowy and unreal, and he half expected to see the
bridge melt, like the vision, into mist before his eyes.</p>
<p>Like one in a dream, he rode with the others to
the place where the path turned abruptly and led
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_125' name='page_125'></a>125</span>
over the bridge to the northern bank of the Columbia.
Like one in a dream he listened, while the
young Willamette told him in a low tone that this
bridge had been built by the gods when the world
was young, that it was the <i>tomanowos</i> of the Willamettes,
that while it stood they would be strongest of
all the tribes, and that if it fell they would fall with
it. As they crossed it, he noted how the great arch
rung to his horse&#8217;s hoofs; he noted the bushes growing
low down to the tunnel&#8217;s edge; he noted how
majestic was the current as it swept into the vast dark
opening below, how stately the trees on either bank.
Then the trail turned down the river-bank again
toward the Willamette, and the dense fir forest shut
out the mysterious bridge from Cecil&#8217;s backward gaze.</p>
<p>Solemnity and awe came to him. He had seen the
bridge of his vision; he had in truth been divinely
called to his work. He felt that the sight of the
bridge was both the visible seal of God upon his
mission and a sign that its accomplishment was close
at hand. He bowed his head involuntarily, as in the
presence of the Most High. He felt that he rode to
his destiny, that for him all things converged and culminated
at the great council.</p>
<p>They had not advanced far into the wood ere the
whole train came to a sudden halt. Riding forward,
Cecil found a band of horsemen awaiting them. They
were Klickitats, mounted on good ponies; neither
women nor pack-horses were with them; they were
armed and painted, and their stern and menacing
aspect was more like that of men who were on the
war-trail than of men who were riding to a &#8220;peace-talk.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_126' name='page_126'></a>126</span></div>
<p>The Cayuses halted a short distance away. Snoqualmie
rode forward and met the Klickitat chief in
the space between the two bands. A few words
passed, fierce and questioning on the part of the
Klickitat, guarded and reserved on the part of the
Cayuse. Then the Klickitat seemed to suggest something
at which the Cayuse shook his head indignantly.
The other instantly wheeled his horse, rode back to
his band, and apparently reported what Snoqualmie
had said; for they all set up a taunting shout, and
after flinging derisive words and gestures at the Cayuses,
turned around and dashed at full gallop down
the trail, leaving the Cayuses covered with a cloud of
dust.</p>
<p>And then Cecil knew that the spectacle meant war.</p>
<p>The air grew softer and more moist as they
descended the western slope of the Cascade Range.
The pines gave way to forests of fir, the underwood
became denser, and ferns grew thick along the trail.
It had rained the night before, and the boughs and
bushes hung heavy with pendant drops. Now and
then an Indian rider, brushing against some vine or
maple or low swaying bough, brought down upon himself
a drenching shower. The disgusted &#8220;ugh!&#8221;
of the victim and the laughter of the others would
bring a smile to even Cecil&#8217;s lips.</p>
<p>And so approaching the sea, they entered the great,
wooded, rainy valley of the lower Columbia. It was
like a different world from the desert sands and prairies
of the upper Columbia. It seemed as if they
were entering a land of perpetual spring. They
passed through groves of spreading oaks; they skirted
lowlands purple with blooming <i>camas</i>; they crossed
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_127' name='page_127'></a>127</span>
prairies where the grass waved rank and high, and
sunny banks where the strawberries were ripening in
scarlet masses. And ever and anon they caught sight
of a far snow peak lifted above the endless reach
of forest, and through openings in the trees caught
glimpses of the Columbia spreading wide and beautiful
between densely wooded shores whose bending
foliage was literally washed by the waters.</p>
<p>At length, as the sun was setting, they emerged
from the wood upon a wide and level beach. Before
them swept the Columbia, broader and grander than at
any previous view, steadily widening as it neared the
sea. Opposite them, another river, not as large as
the Columbia, but still a great river, flowed into it.</p>
<p>&#8220;Willamette,&#8221; said the young runner, pointing to
this new river. &#8220;Wappatto Island,&#8221; he added, indicating
a magnificent prospect of wood and meadow
that lay just below the mouth of the Willamette down
along the Columbia. Cecil could not see the channel
that separated it from the mainland on the other side,
and to him it seemed, not an island, but a part of the
opposite shore.</p>
<p>Around them on the beach were groups of Indians,
representatives of various petty tribes who had not
yet passed to the island of council. Horses were
tethered to the driftwood strewed along the beach;
packs and saddles were heaped on the banks awaiting
the canoes that were to carry them over. Across the
river, Cecil could see upon the island scattered bands
of ponies feeding and many Indians passing to and
fro. Innumerable lodges showed among the trees.
The river was dotted with canoes. Never before had
he beheld so large an encampment, not even among
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_128' name='page_128'></a>128</span>
the Six Nations or the Sioux. It seemed as if all
the tribes of Puget Sound and the Columbia were
there.</p>
<p>As they halted on the bank, a little canoe came
skimming over the water like a bird. It bore a messenger
from Multnomah, who had seen the Cayuses as
soon as they emerged on the beach.</p>
<p>&#8220;Send your packs over in canoes, swim your
horses, camp on the island,&#8221; was the laconic message.
Evidently, in view of the coming struggle, Multnomah
wanted the loyal Cayuses close at hand.</p>
<p>In a little while the horses were stripped of their
packs, which were heaped in the canoes that had followed
the messenger, and the crossing began. A hair
rope was put around the neck of a horse, and the end
given to a man in a canoe. The canoe was then paddled
out into the stream, and the horse partly pulled,
partly pushed into the river. The others after much
beating followed their leader; and in a little while a
long line of half submerged horses and riders was
struggling across the river, while the loaded canoes
brought up the rear. The rapid current swept them
downward, and they landed on the opposite bank at
a point far below that from which they started.</p>
<p>On the bank of the Columbia, near Morgan&#8217;s Lake,
an old gnarled cottonwood still marks the ancient
landing-place; and traces remain of the historic trail
which led up from the river-bank into the interior of
the island,&mdash;a trail traversed perhaps for centuries,&mdash;the
great Indian road from the upper Columbia to the
Willamette valley.</p>
<p>The bank was black with people crowding out to
see the latest arrivals. It was a thronging multitude
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_129' name='page_129'></a>129</span>
of dusky faces and diverse costumes. The Nootka
with his tattooed face was there, clad in his woollen
blanket, his gigantic form pushing aside the short
Chinook of the lower Columbia, with his crooked legs,
his half-naked body glistening with grease, his slit nose
and ears loaded with <i>hiagua</i> shells. Choppunish
women, clad in garments of buckskin carefully whitened
with clay, looked with scorn on the women of
the Cowlitz and Clatsop tribes, whose only dress was
a fringe of cedar bark hanging from the waist. The
abject Siawash of Puget Sound, attired in a scanty
patch-work of rabbit and woodrat skin, stood beside
the lordly Yakima, who wore deerskin robe and leggins.
And among them all, conscious of his supremacy,
moved the keen and imperious Willamette.</p>
<p>They all gazed wonderingly at Cecil, &#8220;the white
man,&#8221; the &#8220;long beard,&#8221; the &#8220;man that came from
the Great Spirit,&#8221; the &#8220;<i>shaman</i> of strong magic,&#8221;&mdash;for
rumors of Cecil and his mission had spread from
tribe to tribe.</p>
<p>Though accustomed to savage sights, this seemed
to Cecil the most savage of all. Flat heads and round
heads; faces scarred, tattooed, and painted; faces as
wild as beasts&#8217;; faces proud and haughty, degraded
and debased; hair cut close to the head, tangled,
matted, clogged with filth, carefully smoothed and
braided,&mdash;every phase of barbarism in its most bloodthirsty
ferocity, its most abject squalor, met his glance
as he looked around him. It seemed like some wild
phantasmagoria, some weird and wondrous dream;
and the discord of tongues, the confusion of dialects,
completed the bewildering scene.</p>
<p>Through the surging crowd they found their
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_130' name='page_130'></a>130</span>
way to the place where their lodges were to be
pitched.</p>
<p>On the morrow the great council was to begin,&mdash;the
council that to the passions of that mob of savages
might be as the torch to dry brushwood. On the
morrow Multnomah would try and would condemn to
death a rebel chief in the presence of the very ones
who were in secret league with him; and the setting
sun would see the Willamette power supreme and
undisputed, or the confederacy would be broken
forever in the death-grapple of the tribes.</p>

<p>Wappatto Island had seen many gatherings of
the tribes, but never before had it seen so
large an assembly as on the opening day of the council.
The great cottonwoods of the council-grove
waved over an audience of sachems and warriors
the like of which the oldest living Indian could not
remember.</p>
<p>No weapons were to be seen, for Multnomah had
commanded that all arms be left that day in the
lodges. But the dissatisfied Indians had come with
weapons hidden under their robes of deer or wolf
skin, which no one should have known better than
Multnomah. Had he taken any precautions against
surprise? Evidently not. A large body of Willamette
warriors, muffled in their blankets, lounged carelessly
around the grove, with not a weapon visible
among them; behind them thronged the vast and
motley assemblage of doubtful allies; and back of
them, on the outskirts of the crowd, were the faithful
Cayuses, unarmed like the Willamettes. Had Multnomah&#8217;s
wonderful astuteness failed him now when it
was never needed more?</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_132' name='page_132'></a>132</span></div>
<p>He was on the council-seat, a stone covered with
furs; the Willamette sachems sat in their places facing
him; and mats were spread for the chiefs of the
tributaries. On a bearskin before the stern war-chief
lay a peace-pipe and a tomahawk; and to the
Indians, accustomed to signs and symbols, the two
had a grim significance.</p>
<p>One by one the chiefs entered the circle and took
their seats on the mats provided for them. Those
who were friendly to Multnomah first laid presents
before him; those who were not, took their places
without offering him either gift or salutation. Multnomah,
however, seemed unconscious of any neglect.</p>
<p>The chief of a Klamath tribe offered him a brilliantly
dyed blanket; another, a finely fringed quiver,
full of arrows; another, a long and massive string of
<i>hiagua</i> shells. Each laid his gift before Multnomah
and took his seat in silence.</p>
<p>The chief of the Chopponish presented him with a
fine horse, the best belonging to his tribe. Multnomah
accepted it, and a slave led it away. Then came
Snoqualmie, bringing with him Cecil Grey. The
chief&#8217;s hour of vengeance was at hand.</p>
<p>&#8220;Behold the white man from the land where the
sun rises, the white <i>shaman</i> of whom all the tribes
have heard. He is thine. Let him be the white
slave of Multnomah. All the chiefs have slaves, but
who will have a white slave like Multnomah?&#8221;</p>
<p>Cecil saw the abyss of slavery yawning before him,
and grew pale to the lips. His heart sank within
him; then the resolute purpose that never failed him
in time of peril returned; he lifted his head and
met Multnomah&#8217;s gaze with dignity. The war-chief
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_133' name='page_133'></a>133</span>
bent on him the glance which read men to the
heart.</p>
<p>&#8220;The white stranger has been a chief among his
own people,&#8221; he said to Cecil, more in the manner of
one asserting a fact than asking a question.</p>
<p>&#8220;I have often spoken to my people in the gatherings
to hear the word of the Great Spirit.&#8221;</p>
<p>Again the keen, inscrutable gaze of the great chief
seemed to probe his being to its core; again the
calm, grave stranger met it without shrinking. The
instinct, so common among savage races, of in some
way <i>knowing</i> what a man is, of intuitively grasping his
true merit, was possessed by Multnomah in a large
degree; and the royalty in his nature instinctively
recognized the royalty in Cecil&#8217;s.</p>
<p>&#8220;The white guest who comes into the land of
Multnomah shall be to him as a guest; the chief
should still be chief in any land. White stranger,
Multnomah gives you welcome; sit down among the
chiefs.&#8221;</p>
<p>Cecil took his place among them with all the composure
he could command, well knowing that he who
would be influential among the Indians must seem to
be unmoved by any change of fortune. He felt, however,
not only the joy of personal deliverance, but
mingled with it came the glad, triumphant thought
that he had now a voice in the deliberations of the
chiefs; it was a grand door opened for Indian evangelization.
As for Snoqualmie, his face was as impassive
as granite. One would have said that Cecil&#8217;s
victory was to him a matter of no moment at all. But
under the guise of indifference his anger burned fierce
and deadly,&mdash;not against Multnomah but against Cecil.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_134' name='page_134'></a>134</span></div>
<p>The last chief had taken his place in the council.
There was a long, ceremonious pause. Then Multnomah
arose. He looked over the council, upon the
stern faces of the Willamettes and the loyal tributaries,
upon the sullen faces of the malcontents, upon the
fierce and lowering multitude beyond. Over the
throng he looked, and felt as one feels who stands
on the brink of a volcano; yet his strong voice never
rang stronger, the grand old chief never looked more
a chief than then.</p>
<p>&#8220;He is every inch a king,&#8221; thought Cecil. The
chief spoke in the common Willamette language, at
that time the medium of intercourse between the
tribes as the Chinook is now. The royal tongue was
not used in a mixed council.</p>
<p>&#8220;Warriors and chiefs, Multnomah gives you welcome.
He spreads the buffalo-robe.&#8221; He made the
Indian gesture of welcome, opening his hands to them
with a backward and downward gesture, as of one
spreading a robe. &#8220;To the warriors Multnomah says,
&#8216;The grass upon my prairies is green for your horses;
behold the wood, the water, the game; they are
yours.&#8217; To the chiefs he says, &#8216;The mat is spread for
you in my own lodge and the meat is cooked.&#8217; The
hearts of the Willamettes change not as the winters
go by, and your welcome is the same as of old. Word
came to us that the tribes were angry and had spoken
bitter things against the Willamettes; yes, that they
longed for the confederacy to be broken and the
old days to come again when tribe was divided against
tribe and the Shoshones and Spokanes trampled upon
you all. But Multnomah trusted his allies; for had
they not smoked the peace-pipe with him and gone
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_135' name='page_135'></a>135</span>
with him on the war-trail? So he stopped his ears and
would not listen, but let those rumors go past him like
thistle-down upon the wind.</p>
<p>&#8220;Warriors, Multnomah has shown his heart. What
say you? Shall the peace-pipe be lighted and the
talk begin?&#8221;</p>
<p>He resumed his seat. All eyes turned to where
the peace-pipe and the tomahawk lay side by side
before the council. Multnomah seemed waiting for
them to choose between the two.</p>
<p>Then Snoqualmie, the bravest and most loyal of the
tributaries, spoke.</p>
<p>&#8220;Let the peace-pipe be lighted; we come not for
strife, but to be knit together.&#8221;</p>
<p>The angry malcontents in the council only frowned
and drew their blankets closer around them. Tohomish
the seer, as the oldest chief and most renowned
medicine-man present, came forward and lighted the
pipe,&mdash;a long, thin piece of carving in black stone,
the workmanship of the Nootkas or Hydahs, who
made the more elaborate pipes used by the Indians
of the Columbia River.</p>
<p>Muttering some mystical incantation, he waved it
to the east and the west, to the north and the
south; and when the charm was complete, gave it
to Multnomah, who smoked it and passed it to Snoqualmie.
From chief to chief it circled around the
whole council, but among them were those who sat
with eyes fixed moodily on the ground and would
not so much as touch or look at it. As the pipe
passed round there was a subdued murmur and movement
in the multitude, a low threatening clamor, as
yet held in check by awe of Multnomah and dread
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_136' name='page_136'></a>136</span>
of the Willamette warriors. But the war-chief seemed
unconscious that any had refused the pipe. He now
arose and said,&mdash;</p>
<p>&#8220;The pipe is smoked. Are not our hearts as one?
Is there not perfect trust between us? Now let us
talk. First of all, Multnomah desires wise words from
his brethren. Last winter one of the tribes rose up
against Multnomah, saying that he should no longer be
elder brother and war-chief of the tribes. But the
rebels were beaten and all of them slain save the
chief, who was reserved to be tried before you. You
in your wisdom shall decide what shall be done with
the warrior who has rebelled against his chief and
stained his hands with the blood of his brethren.&#8221;</p>
<p>Two Willamette braves then entered the circle,
bringing with them one whose hands were tied behind
him, whose form was emaciated with hunger and
disease, but whose carriage was erect and haughty.
Behind came a squaw, following him into the very
presence of Multnomah, as if resolved to share his
fortunes to the last. It was his wife. She was instantly
thrust back and driven with brutal blows from
the council. But she lingered on the outskirts of the
crowd, watching and waiting with mute, sullen fidelity
the outcome of the trial. No one looked at her, no
one cared for her; even her husband&#8217;s sympathizers
jostled the poor shrinking form aside,&mdash;for she was
only a squaw, while he was a great brave.</p>
<p>He looked a great brave, standing there before
Multnomah and the chiefs with a dignity in his mien
that no reverse could crush, no torture could destroy.
Haggard, starved, bound, his eyes gleamed deathless
and unconquerable hate on council and war-chief alike.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_137' name='page_137'></a>137</span>
There were dark and menacing looks among the malcontents;
in the captive they saw personified their
own loss of freedom and the hated domination of
the Willamettes.</p>
<p>&#8220;Speak! You that were a chief, you whose people
sleep in the dust,&mdash;what have you to say in your
defence? The tribes are met together, and the chiefs
sit here to listen and to judge.&#8221;</p>
<p>The rebel sachem drew himself up proudly and
fixed his flashing eyes on Multnomah.</p>
<p>&#8220;The tongue of Multnomah is a trap. I am brought
not to be tried but to be condemned and slain, that
the tribes may see it and be afraid. No one knows
this better than Multnomah. Yet I will speak while
I still live, and stand here in the sun; for I go out
into the darkness, and the earth will cover my face,
and my voice shall be heard no more among men.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why should the Willamettes rule the other tribes?
Are they better than we? The Great Spirit gave us
freedom, and who may make himself master and take
it away?</p>
<p>&#8220;I was chief of a tribe; we dwelt in the land the
Great Spirit gave our fathers; their bones were in it;
it was ours. But the Willamettes said to us, &#8216;We
are your elder brethren, you must help us. Come,
go with us to fight the Shoshones.&#8217; Our young men
went, for the Willamettes were strong and we could
not refuse them. Many were slain, and the women
wailed despairingly. The Willamettes hunted on our
hunting-grounds and dug the <i>camas</i> on our prairies, so
that there was not enough for us; and when winter
came, our children cried for food. Then the runners
of the Willamettes came to us through the snow,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_138' name='page_138'></a>138</span>
saying, &#8216;Come and join the war-party that goes to
fight the Bannocks.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;But our hearts burned within us and we replied,
&#8216;Our hunting-grounds and our food you have
taken; will you have our lives also? Go back and
tell your chief that if we must fight, we will fight him
and not the Bannocks.&#8217; Then the Willamettes came
upon us and we fought them, for their tyranny was so
heavy that we could not breathe under it and death
had become better than life. But they were the
stronger, and when did the heart of a Willamette feel
pity? To-day I only am left, to say these words for
my race.</p>
<p>&#8220;Who made the Willamettes masters over us? The
Great Spirit gave us freedom, and none may take it
away. Was it not well to fight? Yes; free my hands
and give me back my people from the cairns and the
death-huts, and we will fight again! I go to my death,
but the words I have spoken will live. The hearts of
those listening here will treasure them up; they will
be told around the lodge-fires and repeated in the
war-dance. The words I speak will go out among
the tribes, and no man can destroy them. Yes, they
go out words, but they will come back arrows and
war in the day of vengeance when the tribes shall rise
against the oppressor.</p>
<p>&#8220;I have spoken, my words are done.&#8221;</p>
<p>He stood erect and motionless. The wrath and disdain
passed from his features, and stoicism settled
over them like a mask of stone. Multnomah&#8217;s cold
regard had not faltered a moment under the chief&#8217;s
invective. No denunciation could shake that iron
self-control.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_139' name='page_139'></a>139</span></div>
<p>The rebellious chiefs interchanged meaning glances;
the throng of malcontents outside the grove pressed
closer upon the ring of Willamette warriors, who were
still standing or squatting idly around it. More
than one weapon could be seen among them in defiance
of the war-chief&#8217;s prohibition; and the presage
of a terrible storm darkened on those grim, wild
faces. The more peaceably disposed bands began to
draw themselves apart. An ominous silence crept
through the crowd as they felt the crisis approaching.</p>
<p>But Multnomah saw nothing, and the circle of Willamette
warriors were stolidly indifferent.</p>
<p>&#8220;Can they not see that the tribes are on the verge
of revolt?&#8221; thought Cecil, anxiously, fearing a bloody
massacre.</p>
<p>&#8220;You have heard the words of the rebel. What
have you to say? Let the white man speak first, as
he was the last to join us.&#8221;</p>
<p>Cecil rose and pictured in the common Willamette
tongue, with which he had familiarized himself during
his long stay with the Cayuses, the terrible results of
disunion, the desolating consequences of war,&mdash;tribe
clashing against tribe and their common enemies
trampling on them all. Even those who were on the
verge of insurrection listened reverently to the &#8220;white
wizard,&#8221; who had drawn wisdom from the Great Spirit;
but it did not shake their purpose. Their own dreamers
had talked with the Great Spirit too, in trance
and vision, and had promised them victory over
the Willamettes.</p>
<p>Tohomish followed; and Cecil, who had known
some of the finest orators in Europe, listened in
amazement to a voice the most musical he had ever
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_140' name='page_140'></a>140</span>
heard. He looked in wonder on the repulsive features
that seemed so much at variance with those
melodious intonations. Tohomish pleaded for union
and for the death of the rebel. It seemed for a moment
as if his soft, persuasive accents would win the day,
but it was only for a moment; the spell was broken
the instant he ceased. Then Snoqualmie spoke. One
by one, the great sachems of the Willamettes gave
their voices for death. Many of the friendly allies
did not give their decision at all, but said to
Multnomah,&mdash;</p>
<p>&#8220;You speak for us; your word shall be our word.&#8221;</p>
<p>When the dissatisfied chiefs were asked for their
counsel, the sullen reply was given,&mdash;</p>
<p>&#8220;I have no tongue to-day;&#8221; or &#8220;I do not know.&#8221;</p>
<p>Multnomah seemed not to notice their answers.
Only those who knew him best saw a gleam kindling
in his eyes that told of a terrible vengeance drawing
near. The captive waited passively, seeming neither
to see nor hear.</p>
<p>At length all had spoken or had an opportunity to
speak, and Multnomah rose to give the final decision.
Beyond the circle of Willamettes, who were still indifferent
and unconcerned, the discontented bands had
thrown aside all concealment, and stood with bared
weapons in their hands; all murmurs had ceased;
there was a deathlike silence in the dense mob, which
seemed gathering itself together for a forward rush,&mdash;the
commencement of a fearful massacre.</p>
<p>Behind it were the friendly Cayuses, but not a
weapon could be seen among them. The chief saw
all; saw too that his enemies only waited for him
to pronounce sentence upon the captive,&mdash;that that
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_141' name='page_141'></a>141</span>
was the preconcerted signal for attack. Now among
some of the tribes sentence was pronounced not by
word but by gesture; there was the gesture for
acquittal, the gesture for condemnation.</p>
<p>Multnomah lifted his right hand. There was
breathless suspense. What would it be? Fixing his
eyes on the armed malcontents who were waiting to
spring, he clinched his hand and made a downward
gesture, as if striking a blow. It was the death-signal,
the death-sentence.</p>
<p>In an instant a deafening shout rang through the
grove, and the bloodthirsty mob surged forward to the
massacre.</p>
<p>Then, so suddenly that it blended with and seemed
a part of the same shout, the dreaded Willamette war-cry
shook the earth. Quick as thought, the Willamettes
who had been lounging so idly around the
grove were on their feet, their blankets thrown aside,
the weapons that had been concealed under them
ready in their hands. A wall of indomitable warriors
had leaped up around the grove. At the same moment,
the Cayuses in the rear bared their weapons
and shouted back the Willamette war-cry.</p>
<p>The rebels were staggered. The trap was sprung
on them before they knew that there was a trap.
Those in front shrank back from the iron warriors
of Multnomah, those in the rear wavered before the
fierce Cayuses. They paused, a swaying flood of
humanity, caught between two lines of rock.</p>

<p>In that momentary pause Multnomah did something
that showed the cold disdainfulness of his character
as nothing else could have done. He had given
the death-sign; he had not yet told how or when death
was to be inflicted. He gave the sentence <i>now</i>, as if
in utter scorn of the battle-cloud that hung quivering,
ready to burst.</p>
<p>&#8220;He would have torn the confederacy to pieces;
let him be left bound in the wood of the wolves, and
torn limb from limb by them as he would have rent
the tribes asunder.&#8221;</p>
<p>The two warriors who had brought the criminal
into the council came forward, flung a covering over
his head and face, and led him away. Perhaps no
custom of the northwestern Indians was more sombre
than this,&mdash;the covering of the culprit&#8217;s eyes from
the time of his sentence till his death. Never again
were those eyes to behold the sun.</p>
<p>Then, and not till then, did Multnomah turn his
gaze on the malcontents, who stood, desperate but
hesitating, hemmed in by the Willamettes and the
Cayuses.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_143' name='page_143'></a>143</span></div>
<p>&#8220;You have chosen the tomahawk instead of the
peace-pipe. Shall Multnomah choose the tomahawk
also? Know you not that Multnomah holds your lives
in his hand, and that he can crush you like an eggshell
if he chooses?&#8221;</p>
<p>The war-chief lifted his arm as he spoke, and slowly
closed his fingers till his hand was clinched. The
eyes of Willamette and tributary alike hung on those
slowly closing fingers, with their own strained on their
tomahawks. That was half the death-signal! Would
he give the other half,&mdash;the downward gesture? The
baffled rebels tasted all the bitterness of death in that
agonizing suspense. They felt that their lives were
literally in his grasp; and so the stern autocrat wished
them to feel, for he knew it was a lesson they would
never forget.</p>
<p>At length he spoke.</p>
<p>&#8220;Drop your weapons and Multnomah will forget
what he has seen, and all will be well. Strike but a
blow, and not one of you will ever go back over the
trail to his home.&#8221;</p>
<p>Then he turned to the chiefs, and there was that in
his tones which told them to expect no mercy.</p>
<p>&#8220;How comes it that your braves lift their tomahawks
against Multnomah in his own council and on
his own land? Speak! chiefs must answer for their
people.&#8221;</p>
<p>There was sullen silence for a little time; then one
of them muttered that it was the young men; their
blood was hot, they were rash, and the chiefs could
not control them.</p>
<p>&#8220;Can you not control your young men? Then
you are not fit to be chiefs, and are chiefs no longer.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_144' name='page_144'></a>144</span>
He gave a signal to certain of the Willamettes who
had come up behind the rebellious leaders, as they
stood confused and hesitating in the council. They
were seized and their hands bound ere they could
defend themselves; indeed, they made no effort to
do so, but submitted doggedly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Take them down the Wauna in the sea-canoes
and sell them as slaves to the Nootkas who hunt seal
along the coast. Their people shall see their faces
no more. Slaves in the ice-land of the North shall
they live and die.&#8221;</p>
<p>The swarthy cheeks of the captives grew ashen, and
a shudder went through that trapped and surrounded
mob of malcontents. Indian slavery was always terrible;
but to be slaves to the brutal Indians of the north,
starved, beaten, mutilated, chilled, and benumbed in
a land of perpetual frost; to perish at last in the
bleak snow and winter of almost arctic coasts,&mdash;that
was a fate worse than the torture-stake.</p>
<p>Dreadful as it was, not a chief asked for mercy.
Silently they went with their captors out of the grove
and down the bank to the river&#8217;s edge. A large sea-canoe,
manned by Chinook paddlers, was floating at
the beach. They quickly embarked, the paddles
dipped, the canoe glided out into the current and
down the stream. In a few moments the cottonwood
along the river&#8217;s edge hid it from sight, and
the rebels were forever beyond the hope of rescue.</p>
<p>Swift and merciless had the vengeance of Multnomah
fallen, and the insurrection had been crushed at
a blow. It had taken but a moment, and it had all
passed under the eyes of the malcontents, who were
still surrounded by the loyal warriors.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_145' name='page_145'></a>145</span></div>
<p>When the canoe had disappeared and the gaze of
that startled and awed multitude came back to Multnomah,
he made a gesture of dismissal. The lines drew
aside and the rebels were free.</p>
<p>While they were still bewildered and uncertain what
to do, Multnomah instantly and with consummate
address called the attention of the council to other
things, thereby apparently assuming that the trouble
was ended and giving the malcontents to understand
that no further punishment was intended. Sullenly,
reluctantly, they seemed to accept the situation,
and no further indications of revolt were seen that
day.</p>
<p>Popular young men, the bravest of their several
tribes, were appointed by Multnomah to fill the vacant
chieftainships; and that did much toward allaying
the discontent. Moreover, some troubles between
different tribes of the confederacy, which had been
referred to him for arbitration, were decided with rare
sagacity. At length the council ended for the day,
the star of the Willamettes still in the ascendant, the
revolt seemingly subdued.</p>
<p>So the first great crisis passed.</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>That evening a little band of Willamette warriors
led the rebel sachem, still bound and blindfolded,
down to the river&#8217;s bank, where a canoe lay waiting
them. His wife followed and tried to enter it with
him, as if determined to share his fortunes to the very
last; but the guard thrust her rudely away, and
started the canoe. As it moved away she caught
the prow wildly, despairingly, as if she could not let
her warrior go. One of the guards struck her hands
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_146' name='page_146'></a>146</span>
brutally with his paddle, and she released her hold.
The boat glided out into the river. Not a word of
farewell had passed between the condemned man and
his wife, for each disdained to show emotion in the
presence of the enemy. She remained on the bank
looking after him, mute and despondent,&mdash;a forlorn
creature clothed in rags and emaciated with hunger,
an outcast from all the tribes. She might have been
regarded as a symbolic figure representing woman
among the Indians, as she stood there with her bruised
hands, throbbing with pain where the cruel blow had
fallen, hanging, in sullen scorn of pain, uncared for by
her side. So she stood watching the canoe glide down
the river, till it was swallowed up in the gathering
shadows of evening.</p>
<p>The canoe dropped down the river to a lonely point
on the northern shore, a place much frequented by
wolves. There, many miles below the encampment
on the island, they disembarked and took the captive
into the wood. He walked among them with a firm
and even tread; there was no sign of flinching, though
he must have known that his hour was close at hand.
They bound him prostrate at the foot of an oak,
tying him to the hard, tough roots that ran over the
ground like a network, and from which the earth had
been washed away, so that thongs could be passed
around them.</p>
<p>Head and foot they bound him, drawing the rawhide
thongs so tight that they sank into the flesh, and
knotting them, till no effort possible to him could
have disentangled him. It was on his lips to ask
them to leave one arm free, so that he might at least
die fighting, though it were with but one naked hand.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_147' name='page_147'></a>147</span>
But he hated them too much to ask even that small
favor, and so submitted in disdainful silence.</p>
<p>The warriors all went back to the canoe, except
one, an old hunter, famed for his skill in imitating
every cry of bird or beast. Standing beside the bound
and prostrate man, he sent forth into the forest the
cry of a wolf. It rang in a thousand echoes and died
away, evoking no response. He listened a moment
with bated breath, but could hear nothing but the
deep heart-beat of the man at his feet. Another cry,
with its myriad echoes, was followed by the oppressive
sense of stillness that succeeds an outcry in a lonely
wood. Then came a faint, a far-off sound, the answer
of a wolf to a supposed mate. The Indian replied,
and the answer sounded nearer; then another blended
with it, as the pack began to gather. Again the Indian
gave the cry, wild and wolfish, as only a barbarian,
half-beast by virtue of his own nature, could have
uttered it. An awful chorus of barking and howling
burst through the forest as the wolves came on, eager
for blood.</p>
<p>The Indian turned and rejoined his comrades at
the canoe. They pushed out into the river, but held
the boat in the current by an occasional paddle-stroke,
and waited listening. Back at the foot of the tree
the captive strained every nerve and muscle in one
mighty effort to break the cords that bound him; but
it was useless, and he lay back with set teeth and rigid
muscles, while his eyes sought in vain through their
thick covering to see the approach of his foes. Presently
a fierce outburst of howls and snarls told the
listeners that the wolves had found their prey. They
lingered and listened a little longer, but no sound or
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_148' name='page_148'></a>148</span>
cry was heard to tell of the last agony under those
rending fangs; the chief died in silence. Then the
paddles were dipped again in the water, and the canoe
glided up the river to the camp.</p>
<p>When they reached the shore they found the rebel&#8217;s
wife awaiting them in the place where they had left
her. She asked no questions; she only came close
and looked at their faces in the dusk, and read there
the thing she sought to know. Then she went silently
away. In a little while the Indian wail for the dead
was sounding through the forest.</p>
<p>&#8220;What is that?&#8221; asked the groups around the
camp fires.</p>
<p>&#8220;The rebel chief&#8217;s wife wailing the death-wail for
her husband,&#8221; was the low reply; and in that way
the tribes knew that the sentence had been carried
out. Many bands were there, of many languages, but
all knew what that death-wail meant the instant it
fell upon their ears. Multnomah heard it as he sat
in council with his chiefs, and there was something
in it that shook even his iron heart; for all the wilder,
more superstitious elements of the Indians thrilled to
two things,&mdash;the war-cry and the death-wail. He
dismissed his chiefs and went to his lodge. On the
way he encountered Tohomish, lurking, as was his
wont, under the shadow of the trees.</p>
<p>&#8220;What think you now, Tohomish, you who love
darkness and shadow, what think you? Is not the
arm of the Willamette strong? Has it not put down
revolt to-day, and held the tribes together?&#8221;</p>
<p>The Pine Voice looked at him sorrowfully.</p>
<p>&#8220;The vision I told in the council has come back
to me again. The cry of woe I heard far off then is
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_149' name='page_149'></a>149</span>
nearer now, and the throng on the death-trail passes
thicker and swifter. That which covered their faces
is lifted, and their faces are the faces of Willamettes,
and Multnomah is among them. The time is
close at hand.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Say this before our enemies, and, strong <i>tomanowos</i>
though you are, you die!&#8221; said the chief, laying
his hand on his tomahawk. But the seer was gone,
and Multnomah stood alone among the trees.</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>Every evening at dusk, the widow of the rebel
sachem went out into the woods near the camp and
wailed her dead. Every night that wild, desolate
lament was lifted and rang through the great encampment,&mdash;a
cry that was accusation, defiance, and
lament; and even Multnomah dared not silence her,
for among the Indians a woman lamenting her dead
was sacred. So, while Multnomah labored and plotted
for union by day, that mournful cry raised the
spirit of wrath and rebellion by night. And thus the
dead liberator was half avenged.</p>

<p>Never before had there come to Cecil so grand
an opportunity for disseminating gospel truth.
The work of half a lifetime might be done in a few
days.</p>
<p>&#8220;The tribes are all gathered together in one encampment,
and I can talk with them all, tell them of
God, of the beauty of heaven and of the only Way.
Then, when they disperse, they will carry my teaching
in every direction, and so it will be scattered throughout
all this wild land.&#8221;</p>
<p>This was the thought that came to Cecil when he
awoke on the morning after the trial. Now was the
time to work! Now was the time for every element
of argument, persuasion, and enthusiasm to be exerted
to the utmost.</p>
<p>Earnestly did he pray that morning, kneeling in his
lodge beside his couch of furs, that God would be with
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_152' name='page_152'></a>152</span>
and help him. And as he prayed, warm and glowing
was the love and tenderness that filled his heart.
When the day was a little more advanced, he entered
upon his work. The camp was astir with life; nearly
all had finished their morning meal, and the various
employments and diversions of the day were begun.
Each tribe or band had pitched its lodges apart,
though not far from the others. It was not so much
an encampment as a group of many encampments,
and the whole made up a scattered town of huts and
wigwams.</p>
<p>A precarious and uncertain quiet had succeeded the
agitation of the day before. Multnomah&#8217;s energy had
awed the malcontents into temporary submission, and
the different bands were mingling freely with one
another; though here and there a chief or warrior
looked on contemptuously, standing moodily apart,
wrapped in his blanket. Now and then when a Willamette
passed a group who were talking and gesticulating
animatedly they would become silent all at once
till the representative of the dreaded race was out of
hearing, when a storm of indignant gutterals would
burst forth; but there were no other indications of
hostility.</p>
<p>Groups were strolling from place to place observing
curiously the habits and customs of other tribes; the
common Willamette tongue, precursor of the more
modern Chinook jargon, furnishing a means of intercourse.
Everywhere Cecil found talk, barter, diversion.
It was a rude caricature of civilization, the
picture of society in its infancy, the rough dramatization
of that phase through which every race passes
in its evolution from barbarism.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_153' name='page_153'></a>153</span></div>
<p>At one place, a hunter from the interior was bartering
furs for <i>hiagua</i> shells to a native of the sea-coast.
At another, a brave skilled in wood-work had his stock
of bows and arrows spread out before him, and an admiring
crowd were standing around looking on. But
the taciturn brave sat coolly polishing and staining his
arrows as if he were totally unconscious of spectators,
until the magical word &#8220;buy&#8221; was mentioned, when
he at once awoke to life and drove a bargain in bow
and quiver <i>versus</i> dried berries and &#8220;ickters&#8221; that
would have done credit to a Yankee.</p>
<p>At one place sat an old warrior from the upper
Columbia, making arrow-heads, chipping off the little
scales of flint with infinite patience, literally <i>wearing</i>
the stone into the requisite shape. Beside him lay a
small pack of flints brought from beyond the mountains,
for such stone was rarely found along the lower
Columbia. Squaws sat in front of their wigwams sewing
mats,&mdash;carefully sorting the rushes, putting big
ends with little ends, piercing each with a bodkin, and
sewing them all together with a long bone needle
threaded with buckskin or sinew. Others were weaving
that water-tight wickerwork which was, perhaps,
the highest art to which the Oregon Indians ever
attained. Here a band of Indians were cooking,
feasting, laughing, shouting around a huge sturgeon
captured the night before. There a circle of gamblers
were playing &#8220;hand,&#8221;&mdash;passing a small stick secretly
from hand to hand and guessing whose hand contained
it,&mdash;singing as they played that monotonous &#8220;ho-ha,
ho-ha, ho-ha,&#8221; which was the inseparable accompaniment
of dancing, gambling, and horseback riding.</p>
<p>Among them all Cecil moved with the calm dignity
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_154' name='page_154'></a>154</span>
he had acquired from long intercourse with the Indians.
Wherever he went there was silence and respect,
for was he not the great white medicine-man?
Gambling circles paused in the swift passage of the
stick and the monotone of the chant to look and to
comment; buyers and sellers stopped to gaze and to
question; children who had been building miniature
wigwams of sticks or floating bark canoes in the
puddles, ran away at his approach and took shelter
in the thickets, watching him with twinkling black
eyes.</p>
<p>Wherever there was opportunity, he stopped and
talked, scattering seed-thoughts in the dark minds
of the Indians. Wherever he paused a crowd would
gather; whenever he entered a wigwam a throng
collected at the door.</p>
<p>Let us glance for a moment into the domestic life
of the Indians as Cecil saw it that morning.</p>
<p>He enters one of the large bark huts of the Willamette
Indians, a long, low building, capable of sheltering
sixty or seventy persons. The part around the
door is painted to represent a man&#8217;s face, and the
entrance is through the mouth. Within, he finds a
spacious room perhaps eighty or a hundred feet long
by twenty wide, with rows of rude bunks rising tier
above tier on either side. In the centre are the
stones and ashes of the hearth; above is an aperture
in the roof for the escape of smoke; around the
hearth mats are spread to sit upon; the bare ground,
hard and trodden, forms the only floor, and the roof
is made of boards that have been split out with mallet
and wedges.</p>
<p>Cecil enters and stands a moment in silence; then
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_155' name='page_155'></a>155</span>
the head of the house advances and welcomes him.
The best mat is spread for him to sit upon; food is
brought,&mdash;pounded fish, nuts, and berries, and a kind
of bread made of roots cooked, crushed together, and
cut in slices when cold. All this is served on a wooden
platter, and he must eat whether hungry or not; for
to refuse would be the grossest affront that could be
offered a Willamette host, especially if it were presented
by his own hands. The highest honor that a
western Oregon Indian could do his guest was to wait
on him instead of letting his squaw do it. The Indian
host stands beside Cecil and says, in good-humored
hospitality, &#8220;Eat, eat much,&#8221; nor is he quite pleased
if he thinks that his visitor slights the offered food.
When the guest can be no longer persuaded to eat
more, the food is removed, the platter is washed in
water, and dried with a wisp of twisted grass; a small
treasure of tobacco is produced from a little buckskin
pocket and a part of it carefully mixed with dried
leaves;<a name='FNanchor_0010' id='FNanchor_0010'></a><a href='#Footnote_0010' class='fnanchor'>[10]</a> the pipe is filled and smoked. Then, and
not till then, may the Indian host listen to the talk of
the white man.</p>
<p>So it was in lodge after lodge; he must first eat, be
it ever so little. Two centuries later, the Methodist
and Congregational missionaries found themselves confronted
with the same oppressive hospitality among
the Rocky Mountain Indians.<a name='FNanchor_0011' id='FNanchor_0011'></a><a href='#Footnote_0011' class='fnanchor'>[11]</a> Nay, they need not
visit a wigwam; let them but stroll abroad through
the village, and if they were popular and the camp
was well supplied with buffalo-meat, messengers would
come with appalling frequency, bearing the laconic
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_156' name='page_156'></a>156</span>
invitation, &#8220;Come and eat;&#8221; and the missionary
must go, or give offence, even though he had already
gone to half a dozen wigwams on the same errand.
There is a grim humor in a missionary&#8217;s eating fresh
buffalo-meat in the cause of religion until he is
like to burst, and yet heroically going forth to choke
down a few mouthfuls more, lest he offend some
dusky convert.</p>
<p>At one house Cecil witnessed a painful yet comical
scene. The Willamettes were polygamists, each brave
having as many wives as he was able to buy; and
Cecil was in a lodge where the brother of the head
man of that lodge brought home his second wife. At
the entrance of the second wife, all gay in Indian
finery, the first did not manifest the sisterly spirit
proper for the occasion. After sitting awhile in sullen
silence, she arose and began to kick the fire about,
accompanying that performance with gutteral exclamations
addressed to no one in particular; she struck
the dog, which chanced to be in the way, sending it
yelping from the wigwam; and then, having worked
herself into a rage, began to scold her husband, who
listened grimly but said nothing. At last she turned
on her new-found sister, struck her, and began to lay
rending hands on the finery that their mutual husband
had given her. That was instantly resented; and in
a few moments the squaws were rolling on the floor,
biting, scratching, and pulling each other&#8217;s hair with
the fury of devils incarnate. The dogs, attracted by
the tumult, ran in and began to bark at them; the
Indians outside the hut gathered at the door, looking
in and laughing; the husband contemplated them as
they rolled fighting at his feet, and then looked at
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_157' name='page_157'></a>157</span>
Cecil. It was undoubtedly trying to Indian dignity
but the warrior sustained his admirably. &#8220;Bad, very
bad,&#8221; was the only comment he allowed himself to
make. Cecil took his leave, and the brave kept up
his air of indifference until the white man had gone.
Then he quietly selected a cudgel from the heap of
fire-wood by the doorway, and in a short time peace
reigned in the wigwam.</p>
<p>In a lodge not far away, Cecil witnessed another
scene yet more barbarous than this. He found a
little blind boy sitting on the ground near the fire,
surrounded by a quantity of fish-bones which he had
been picking. He was made a subject for the taunting
jibes and laughter of a number of men and women
squatting around him. His mother sat by in the most
cruel apathy and unconcern, and only smiled when
Cecil expressed commiseration for her unfortunate
and peculiarly unhappy child. It had been neglected
and seemed almost starved. Those around apparently
took pleasure in tormenting it and rendering it miserable,
and vied with each other in applying to it insulting
and degrading epithets. The little articles that
Cecil gave to it, in the hope that the Indians seeing
him manifest an interest in it would treat it more tenderly,
it put to its mouth eagerly; but not finding
them eatable, it threw them aside in disgust. Cecil
turned away sick at heart. Worn, already weary, this
last sight was intolerable; and he went out into the
woods, away from the camp.</p>
<p>But as he walked along he seemed to see the child
again, so vividly had it impressed his imagination. It
rose before him in the wood, when the noise of the
camp lay far behind; it seemed to turn its sightless
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_158' name='page_158'></a>158</span>
eyes upon him and reach out its emaciated arms as if
appealing for help.<a name='FNanchor_0012' id='FNanchor_0012'></a><a href='#Footnote_0012' class='fnanchor'>[12]</a></p>
<p>Out in the wood he came across an Indian sitting
on a log, his face buried in his hands, his attitude indicating
sickness or despondency. He looked up as
Cecil approached. It was the young Willamette runner
who had been his companion on the journey down
the Columbia. His face was haggard; he was evidently
very sick. The missionary stopped and tried
to talk with him, but could evoke little response, except
that he did not want to talk, and that he wanted
to be left alone. He seemed so moody and irritable
that Cecil thought it best to leave him. His experience
was that talking with a sick Indian was very much
like stirring up a wounded rattlesnake. So he left the
runner and went on into the forest, seeking the solitude
without which he could scarcely have lived amid
the degrading barbarism around him. His spirit required
frequent communion with God and Nature,
else he would have died of weariness and sickness
of heart.</p>
<p>Wandering listlessly, he went on further and further
from the camp, never dreaming of what lay before
him, or of the wild sweet destiny to which that dim
Indian trail was leading him through the shadowy
wood.</p>

<p>Cecil walked listlessly on through the wood. He
was worn out by the day&#8217;s efforts, though it was
as yet but the middle of the afternoon. There was
a feeling of exhaustion in his lungs, a fluttering pain
about his heart, the result of years of over-work upon
a delicate frame. With this feeling of physical weakness
came always the fear that his strength might
give way ere his work was done. Nor was this all.
In these times of depression, the longing to see again
the faces of his friends, to have again the sweet graceful
things of the life that was forever closed to him,
rushed over him in a bitter flood.</p>
<p>The trail led him to the bank of the Columbia,
some distance below the encampment. He looked
out over the blue river sweeping majestically on, the
white snow-peaks, the canyons deep in the shadows
of afternoon, the dense forest beyond the river extending
away to the unknown and silent North as far
as his eyes could reach.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is wonderful, wonderful!&#8221; he thought. &#8220;But I
would give it all to look upon one white face.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_160' name='page_160'></a>160</span></div>
<p>So musing, he passed on down the bank of the
river. He was now perhaps two miles from the camp
and seemingly in complete solitude. After a little the
path turned away from the beach and led toward the
interior. As he entered the woodland he came upon
several Indian sentinels who lay, bow in hand, beside
the path. They sprang up, as if to intercept his passage;
but seeing that it was the white <i>shaman</i> whom
Multnomah had honored, and who had sat at the
council with the great sachems, they let him go on.
Cecil indistinctly remembered having heard from
some of the Indians that this part of the island was
strictly guarded; he had forgotten why. So absorbed
was he in his gloomy reflections that he did not stop
to question the sentinels, but went on, not thinking
that he might be treading on forbidden ground. By
and by the path emerged from the wood upon a little
prairie; the cottonwoods shut out the Indians from
him, and he was again alone. The sunshine lay warm
and golden on the little meadow, and he strolled forward
mechanically, thinking how like it was to some
of the sylvan lawns of his own New England forests.
Again the shade of trees fell over the path.
He looked up, his mind full of New England memories,
and saw something that made his heart stand
still. For there, not far from him, stood a girl clad
in soft flowing drapery, the dress of a white woman.
In Massachusetts a woman&#8217;s dress would have been
the last thing Cecil would have noticed. Now, so
long accustomed to the Indian squaws&#8217; rough garments
of skin or plaited bark, the sight of that graceful
woven cloth sent through him an indescribable
thrill.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_161' name='page_161'></a>161</span></div>
<p>He went on, his eager eyes drinking in the welcome
sight, yet scarcely believing what he saw.</p>
<p>She had not yet observed him. The profile of her
half-averted face was very sweet and feminine; her
form was rounded, and her hair fell in long black
ringlets to the shoulders. He was in the presence of
a young and beautiful woman,&mdash;a white woman! All
this he noted at a glance; noted, too, the drooping
lashes, the wistful lines about the lips, the mournful
expression that shadowed the beauty of her face.</p>
<p>Who was she? Where could she have come from?</p>
<p>She heard the approaching footsteps and turned
toward him. Absolute bewilderment was on her face
for a moment, and then it glowed with light and joy.
Her dark, sad eyes sparkled. She was radiant, as if
some great, long-looked for happiness had come to
her. She came eagerly toward him, holding out her
hands in impetuous welcome; saying something in a
language he did not understand, but which he felt
could not be Indian, so refined and pleasing were
the tones.</p>
<p>He answered he knew not what, in his own tongue,
and she paused perplexed. Then he spoke again,
this time in Willamette.</p>
<p>She shrank back involuntarily.</p>
<p>&#8220;That language?&#8221; she replied in the same tongue,
but with a tremor of disappointment in her voice.
&#8220;I thought you were of my mother&#8217;s race and spoke
her language. But you <i>are</i> white, like her people?&#8221;</p>
<p>She had given him both her hands, and he stood
holding them; looking down into her eager, lifted
face, where a great hope and a great doubt in mingled
light and shadow strove together.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_162' name='page_162'></a>162</span></div>
<p>&#8220;I am a white man. I came from a land far to
the East. But who are you, and how came you
here?&#8221;</p>
<p>She did not seem to hear the last words, only the
first.</p>
<p>&#8220;No, no,&#8221; she protested eagerly, &#8220;you came not
from the East but from the West, the land across the
sea that my mother came from in the ship that was
wrecked.&#8221; And she withdrew one hand and pointed
toward the wooded range beyond which lay the
Pacific.</p>
<p>He shook his head. &#8220;No, there are white people
in those lands too, but I never saw them. I came
from the East,&#8221; he said, beginning to surmise that
she must be an Asiatic. She drew away the hand
that he still held in his, and her eyes filled with
tears.</p>
<p>&#8220;I thought you were one of my mother&#8217;s people,&#8221;
she murmured; and he felt that the pang of an exceeding
disappointment was rilling her heart.</p>
<p>&#8220;Who are you?&#8221; he asked gently.</p>
<p>&#8220;The daughter of Multnomah.&#8221;</p>
<p>Cecil remembered now what he had heard of the
dead white wife of Multnomah, and of her daughter,
who, it was understood among the tribes, was to be
given to Snoqualmie. He noticed, too, for the first
time the trace of the Indian in her expression, as the
light faded from it and it settled back into the
despondent look habitual to it. All that was chivalrous
in his nature went out to the fair young creature;
all his being responded to the sting of her
disappointment.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am not what you hoped I was, but your face is
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_163' name='page_163'></a>163</span>
like the face of the women of my own land. Shall we
not be friends?&#8221;</p>
<p>She looked up wistfully at the handsome and noble
countenance above her, so different from the stolid
visages she had known so long.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes; you are not Indian.&#8221;</p>
<p>In that one expression she unconsciously told
Cecil how her sensitive nature shrank from the barbarism
around her; how the tastes and aspirations
she had inherited from her mother reached out for
better and higher things.</p>
<p>In a little while they were seated on a grassy bank
in the shade of the trees, talking together. She bade
him tell her of his people. She listened intently; the
bright, beautiful look came back as she heard the tale.</p>
<p>&#8220;They are kind to women, instead of making
them mere burden-bearers; they have pleasant
homes; they dwell in cities? Then they are like
my mother&#8217;s people.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;They are gentle, kind, humane. They have all
the arts that light up life and make it beautiful,&mdash;not
like the tribes of this grim, bloodstained land.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;<i>This</i> land!&#8221; Her face darkened and she lifted
her hand in a quick, repelling gesture. &#8220;This land
is a grave. The clouds lie black and heavy on the
spirit that longs for the sunlight and cannot reach it.&#8221;
She turned to him again. &#8220;Go on, your words are
music.&#8221;</p>
<p>He continued, and she listened till the story of
his country and his wanderings was done. When he
ended, she drew a glad, deep breath; her eyes were
sparkling with joy.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am content,&#8221; she said, in a voice in which there
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_164' name='page_164'></a>164</span>
was a deep heart-thrill of happiness. &#8220;Since my
mother died I have been alone, all alone; and I
longed, oh so often, for some one who talked and felt
as she did to come to me, and now you have come.
I sat cold and shivering in the night a long time, but
the light and warmth have come at last. Truly, Allah
is good!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Allah!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes; he was my mother&#8217;s God, as the Great
Spirit is my father&#8217;s.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;They are both names for the same All Father,&#8221;
replied Cecil. &#8220;They mean the same thing, even as
the sun is called by many names by many tribes, yet
there is but the one sun.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then I am glad. It is good to learn that both
prayed to the one God, though they did not know
it. But my mother taught me to use the name of
Allah, and not the other. And while my father and
the tribes call me by my Indian name, &#8216;Wallulah,&#8217;
she gave me another, a secret name, that I was never
to forget.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What is it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I have never told it, but I will tell you, for you
can understand.&#8221;</p>
<p>And she gave him a singularly melodious name, of
a character entirely different from any he had ever
heard, but which he guessed to be Arabic or Hindu.</p>
<p>&#8220;It means, &#8216;She who watches for the morning.&#8217;
My mother told me never to forget it, and to remember
that I was not to let myself grow to be like the
Indians, but to pray to Allah, and to watch and hope,
and that sometime the morning would come and I
would be saved from the things around me. And
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_165' name='page_165'></a>165</span>
now you have come and the dawn comes with
you.&#8221;</p>
<p>Her glad, thankful glance met his; the latent grace
and mobility of her nature, all roused and vivid under
his influence, transfigured her face, making it delicately
lovely. A great pang of longing surged through
him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh,&#8221; he thought, &#8220;had I not become a missionary,
I might have met and loved some one like her! I
might have filled my life with much that is now gone
from it forever!&#8221;</p>
<p>For eight years he had seen only the faces of savage
women and still more savage men; for eight years his
life had been steeped in bitterness, and all that was
tender or romantic in his nature had been cramped,
as in iron fetters, by the coarseness and stolidity around
him. Now, after all that dreary time, he met one who
had the beauty and the refinement of his own race.
Was it any wonder that her glance, the touch of her
dress or hair, the soft tones of her voice, had for him
an indescribable charm? Was it any wonder that his
heart went out to her in a yearning tenderness that
although not love was dangerously akin to it?</p>
<p>He was startled at the sweet and burning tumult of
emotion she was kindling within him. What was he
thinking of? He must shake these feelings off, or
leave her. Leave her! The gloom of the savagery
that awaited him at the camp grew tenfold blacker
than ever. All the light earth held for him seemed
gathered into the presence of this dark-eyed girl who
sat talking so musically, so happily, by his side.</p>
<p>&#8220;I must go,&#8221; he forced himself to say at length,
&#8220;The sun is almost down.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_166' name='page_166'></a>166</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Must you go so soon?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I will come again if you wish.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But you must not go yet; wait till the sun reaches
the mountain-tops yonder. I want you to tell me
more about your own land.&#8221;</p>
<p>So he lingered and talked while the sun sank lower
and lower in the west. It seemed to him that it had
never gone down so fast before.</p>
<p>&#8220;I must go now,&#8221; he said, rising as the sun&#8217;s red
disk sank behind the mountains.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is not late; see, the sun is shining yet on the
brow of the snow mountains.&#8221;</p>
<p>Both looked at the peaks that towered grandly in
the light of the sunken sun while all the world below
lay in shadow. Together they watched the mighty
miracle of the afterglow on Mount Tacoma, the soft
rose-flush that transfigured the mountain till it grew
transparent, delicate, wonderful.</p>
<p>&#8220;That is what my life is now,&mdash;since you have
brought the light to the &#8216;watcher for the morning;&#8217;&#8221;
and she looked up at him with a bright, trustful smile.</p>
<p>&#8220;Alas?&#8221; thought Cecil, &#8220;it is not the light of morning
but of sunset.&#8221;</p>
<p>Slowly the radiance faded, the rose tint passed; the
mountain grew white and cold under their gaze, like
the face of death. Wallulah shuddered as if it were
a prophecy.</p>
<p>&#8220;You will come back to-morrow?&#8221; she said, looking
at him with her large, appealing eyes.</p>
<p>&#8220;I will come,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;It will seem long till your return, yet I have lived
so many years waiting for that which has come at last
that I have learned to be patient.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_167' name='page_167'></a>167</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Ask God to help you in your hours of loneliness
and they will not seem so long and dark,&#8221; said Cecil,
whose soul was one tumultuous self-reproach that he
had let the time go by without telling her more of
God.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah!&#8221; she said in a strange, wistful way, &#8220;I have
prayed to him so much, but he could not fill <i>all</i> my
heart. I wanted so to touch a hand and look on a
face like my mother&#8217;s. But God has sent you, and
so I know he must be good.&#8221;</p>
<p>They parted, and he went back to the camp.</p>
<p>&#8220;Is my mission a failure?&#8221; he thought, as he
walked along, clinching his hands in furious anger
with himself. &#8220;Why do I let a girl&#8217;s beauty move
me thus, and she the promised wife of another?
How dare I think of aught beside the work God has
sent me here to do? Oh, the shame and guilt of
such weakness! I will be faithful. I will never look
upon her face again!&#8221;</p>
<p>He emerged from the wood into the camp; its
multitudinous sounds were all around him, and never
had the coarseness and savagery of Indian life seemed
so repellent as now, when he came back to it with his
mind full of Wallulah&#8217;s grace and loveliness. It was
harsh discord after music.</p>
<p>Stripped and painted barbarians were hallooing,
feasting, dancing; the whole camp was alive with
boisterous hilarity, the result of a day of good fellowship.
Mothers were calling their children in the
dusk and young men were sportively answering,
&#8220;Here I am, mother.&#8221; Here and there, Indians who
had been feasting all day lay like gorged anacondas
beside the remnant of their meal; others, who had
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_168' name='page_168'></a>168</span>
been gambling, were talking loudly of the results of
the game.</p>
<p>Through it all the white man walked with swift
footsteps, looking neither to the right nor the left,
till he gained his lodge. He flung himself on his bed
and lay there, his fingers strained together convulsively,
his nerves throbbing with pain; vainly struggling
with regret, vainly repeating to himself that he
cared nothing for love and home, that he had put all
those things from him, that he was engrossed now
only in his work.</p>
<p>&#8220;Never, never! It can never be.&#8221;</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>And the English exploring-ship in Yaquina Bay was
to weigh anchor on the morrow, and sail up nearer
along the unknown coast. The Indians had all deserted
the sea-board for the council. Would Cecil
hear? Would any one see the sail and bring the
news?</p>

<p>On the next day came the races, the great diversion
of the Indians. Each tribe ran only one
horse,&mdash;the best it had. There were thirty tribes or
bands, each with its choicest racer on the track. The
Puget Sound and lower Columbia Indians, being destitute
of horses, were not represented. There had
been races every day on a small scale, but they were
only private trials of speed, while to-day was the great
day of racing for all the tribes, the day when the head
chiefs ran their horses.</p>
<p>The competition was close, but Snoqualmie the
Cayuse won the day. He rode the fine black horse
he had taken from the Bannock he had tortured to
death. Multnomah and the chiefs were present, and
the victory was won under the eyes of all the tribes.
The haughty, insolent Cayuse felt that he had gained
a splendid success. Only, as in the elation of victory
his glance swept over the crowd, he met the sad, unapplauding
gaze of Cecil, and it made his ever burning
resentment grow hotter still.</p>
<p>&#8220;I hate that man,&#8221; he thought. &#8220;I tried to thrust
him down into slavery, and Multnomah made him a
chief. My heart tells me that he is an enemy. I
hate him. I will kill him.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_170' name='page_170'></a>170</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Poor Wallulah!&#8221; Cecil was thinking. &#8220;What a
terrible future is before her as the wife of that inhuman
torturer of men!&#8221;</p>
<p>And his sympathies went out to the lonely girl, the
golden thread of whose life was to be interwoven with
the bloodstained warp and woof of Snoqualmie&#8217;s.
But he tried hard not to think of her; he strove resolutely
that day to absorb himself in his work, and
the effort was not unsuccessful.</p>
<p>After the races were over, a solemn council was
held in the grove and some important questions discussed
and decided. Cecil took part, endeavoring in
a quiet way to set before the chiefs a higher ideal of
justice and mercy than their own. He was heard with
grave attention, and saw that more than one chief
seemed impressed by his words. Only Snoqualmie
was sullen and inattentive, and Mishlah the Cougar
was watchful and suspicious.</p>
<p>After the council was over Cecil went to his lodge.
On the way he found the young Willamette runner
sitting on a log by the path, looking even more woebegone
than he had the day before. Cecil stopped to
inquire how he was.</p>
<p>&#8220;<i>Cultus</i> [bad],&#8221; was grunted in response.</p>
<p>&#8220;Did you see the races?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Races bad. What do I care?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I hope you will be better soon.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, better or worse by and by. What do I
care?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Can I do anything for you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What is it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Go.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_171' name='page_171'></a>171</span></div>
<p>And he dropped his hand upon his knees, doubled
himself together, and refused to say another word.
As Cecil turned to go he found Multnomah standing
close by, watching him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Come,&#8221; said the stern despot, briefly. &#8220;I want
to talk with you.&#8221;</p>
<p>He led the way back through the noisy encampment
to the now deserted grove of council. Everything
there was quiet and solitary; the thick circle of
trees hid them from the camp, though its various
sounds floated faintly to them. They were quite
alone. Multnomah seated himself on the stone covered
with furs, that was his place in the council.
Cecil remained standing before him, wondering what
was on his mind. Was the war-chief aware of his
interview with Wallulah? If so, what then? Multnomah
fixed on him the gaze which few men met
without shrinking.</p>
<p>&#8220;Tell me,&#8221; he said, while it seemed to Cecil as if
that eagle glance read every secret of his innermost
heart, &#8220;tell me where your land is, and why you left
it, and the reason for your coming among us. Keep
no thought covered, for Multnomah will see it if you
do.&#8221;</p>
<p>Cecil&#8217;s eye kindled, his cheek flushed. Wallulah was
forgotten; his mission, and his mission only, was remembered.
He stood before one who held over the
many tribes of the Wauna the authority of a prince:
if <i>he</i> could but be won for Christ, what vast results
might follow!</p>
<p>He told it all,&mdash;the story of his home and his work,
his call of God to go to the Indians, his long wanderings,
the message he had to deliver, how it had been
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_172' name='page_172'></a>172</span>
received by some and rejected by many; now he was
here, a messenger sent by the Great Spirit to tell the
tribes of the Wauna the true way of life. He told it
all, and never had he been so eloquent. It was a
striking contrast, the grim Indian sitting there leaning
on his bow, his sharp, treacherous gaze bent like a
bird of prey on the delicately moulded man pleading
before him.</p>
<p>He listened till Cecil began to talk of love and
forgiveness as duties enjoined by the Great Spirit.
Then he spoke abruptly.</p>
<p>&#8220;When you stood up in the council the day the bad
chief was tried, and told of the weakness and the wars
that would come if the confederacy was broken up,
you talked wisely and like a great chief and warrior;
now you talk like a woman. Love! forgiveness!&#8221;
He repeated the words, looking at Cecil with a kind
of wondering scorn, as if he could not comprehend
such weakness in one who looked like a brave man.
&#8220;War and hate are the life of the Indian. They are
the strength of his heart. Take them away, and you
drain the blood from his veins; you break his spirit;
he becomes a squaw.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But my people love and forgive, yet they are not
squaws. They are brave and hardy in battle; their
towns are great; their country is like a garden.&#8221;</p>
<p>And he told Multnomah of the laws, the towns, the
schools, the settled habits and industry of New England.
The chief listened with growing impatience.
At length he threw his arm up with an indescribable
gesture of freedom, like a man rejecting a fetter.</p>
<p>&#8220;How can they breathe, shut in, bound down like
that? How can they live, so tied and burdened?&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_173' name='page_173'></a>173</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Is not that better than tribe forever warring
against tribe? Is it not better to live like men than
to lurk in dens and feed on roots like beasts? Yet
we will fight, too; the white man does not love war,
but he will go to battle when his cause is just and war
must be.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;So will the deer and the cayote fight when they
can flee no longer. The Indian loves battle. He
loves to seek out his enemy, to grapple with him, and
to tread him down. That is a man&#8217;s life!&#8221;</p>
<p>There was a wild grandeur in the chief&#8217;s tone. All
the tameless spirit of his race seemed to speak through
him, the spirit that has met defeat and extermination
rather than bow its neck to the yoke of civilization.
Cecil realized that on the iron fibre of the war-chief&#8217;s
nature his pleading made no impression whatever, and
his heart sank within him.</p>
<p>Again he tried to speak of the ways of peace, but
the chief checked him impatiently.</p>
<p>&#8220;That is talk for squaws and old men. Multnomah
does not understand it. Talk like a man, if you wish
him to listen. Multnomah does not forgive; Multnomah
wants no peace with his enemies. If they are
weak he tramples on them and makes them slaves; if
they are strong he fights them. When the Shoshones
take from Multnomah, he takes from them; if they
give him war he gives them war; if they torture one
Willamette at the stake, Multnomah stretches two Shoshones
upon red-hot stones. Multnomah gives hate
for hate and war for war. This is the law the Great
Spirit has given the Indian. What law he has given
the white man, Multnomah knows not nor cares!&#8221;</p>
<p>Baffled in his attempt, Cecil resorted to another
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_174' name='page_174'></a>174</span>
line of persuasion. He set before Multnomah the
arts, the intelligence, the splendor of the white race.</p>
<p>&#8220;The Indian has his laws and customs, and that is
well; but why not council with the white people, even
as chiefs council together? Send an embassy to
ask that wise white men be sent you, so that you
may learn of their arts and laws; and what seems
wise and good you can accept, what seems not so
can be set aside. I know the ways that lead back to
the land of the white man; I myself would lead the
embassy.&#8221;</p>
<p>It was a noble conception,&mdash;that of making a treaty
between this magnificent Indian confederacy and New
England for the purpose of introducing civilization and
religion; and for a moment he lost sight of the insurmountable
obstacles in the way.</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; replied the chief, &#8220;neither alone nor as
leader of a peace party will your feet ever tread again
the path that leads back to the land of the white man.
We want not upon our shoulders the burden of his
arts and laws. We want not his teachers to tell us
how to be women. If the white man wants us, let
him find his way over the desert and through the
mountains, and we will grapple with him and see
which is the strongest.&#8221;</p>
<p>So saying, the war-chief rose and left him.</p>
<p>&#8220;He says that I shall never be allowed to go back,&#8221;
thought Cecil, with a bitter consciousness of defeat.
&#8220;Then my mission ends here in the land of the
Bridge, even as I have so often dreamed that it would.
So be it; I shall work the harder now that I see the
end approaching. I shall gather the chiefs in my
own lodge this evening and preach to them.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_175' name='page_175'></a>175</span></div>
<p>While he was forming his resolution, there came
the recollection that Wallulah would look for him,
would be expecting him to come to her.</p>
<p>&#8220;I cannot,&#8221; he thought, though he yearned to go
to her. &#8220;I cannot go; I must be faithful to my
mission.&#8221;</p>
<p>Many chiefs came that night to his lodge; among
them, to his surprise, Tohomish the seer. Long and
animated was Cecil&#8217;s talk; beautiful and full of spiritual
fervor were the words in which he pointed them
to a better life. Tohomish was impassive, listening
in his usual brooding way. The others seemed interested;
but when he was done they all rose up and
went away without a word,&mdash;all except the Shoshone
renegade who had helped him bury the dead Bannock.
He came to Cecil before leaving the lodge.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sometime,&#8221; he said, &#8220;when it will be easier for
me to be good than it is now, I will try to live the
life you talked about to-night.&#8221;</p>
<p>Then he turned and went out before Cecil could
reply.</p>
<p>&#8220;There is one at least seeking to get nearer God,&#8221;
thought Cecil, joyfully. After awhile his enthusiasm
faded away, and he remembered how anxiously Wallulah
must have waited for him, and how bitterly she
must have been disappointed. Her face, pale and
stained with tears, rose plainly before him. A deep
remorse filled his heart.</p>
<p>&#8220;Poor child! I am the first white person she has
seen since her mother died; no wonder she longs for
my presence! I must go to her to-morrow. After
all, there is no danger of my caring for her. To me
my work is all in all.&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IV.</h2>
<h3>ARCHERY AND GAMBLING.</h3>
</div>
<p style='margin-left:2.0em; margin-right:2.0em; '>To gambling they are no less passionately addicted in the interior than on the coast.&mdash;<span style='font-variant:small-caps'>Bancroft</span>: <i>Native Races</i>.</p>
<hr style='border:none; height:1em;' />
<p>The next morning came the archery games. The
best marksmen of each tribe contended together
under the eyes of Multnomah, and Snoqualmie the
Cayuse won the day.</p>
<p>These diversions were beginning to produce the
result that the politic chief had intended they should.
Better feeling was springing up. The spirit of discontent
that had been rife was disappearing. Every day
good-fellowship grew more and more between the
Willamettes and their allies. Every day Snoqualmie
the Cayuse became more popular among the tribes,
and already he was second in influence to none but
Multnomah himself.</p>
<p>The great war-chief had triumphed over every
obstacle; and he waited now only for the last day of
the council, when his daughter should be given to
Snoqualmie and the chiefs should recognize him as
the future head of the confederacy.</p>
<p>Knowing this, the sight of Snoqualmie&#8217;s successful
archery was almost intolerable to Cecil, and he turned
away from the place where the games were held.</p>
<p>&#8220;I will seek the young Willamette who is sick,&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_177' name='page_177'></a>177</span>
he said to himself. &#8220;Then this evening I will go and
visit Wallulah.&#8221;</p>
<p>The thought sent the blood coursing warmly through
his veins, but he chided himself for it. &#8220;It is but
duty, I go to her only as a missionary,&#8221; he repeated
to himself over and over again.</p>
<p>He went to the lodge of the young Willamette and
asked for him.</p>
<p>&#8220;He is not here,&#8221; the father of the youth told him.
&#8220;He is in the sweat-house. He is sick this morning,
<i>hieu</i> sick.&#8221;</p>
<p>And the old man emphasized the <i>hieu</i> [much],
with a prolonged intonation and a comprehensive
gesture as if the young man were very sick indeed.
To the sweat-house went Cecil forthwith. He found
it to be a little arched hut, made by sticking the ends
of bent willow-wands into the ground and covering
them over with skins, leaving only a small opening
for entrance. When a sick person wished to take one
of those &#8220;sweat baths&#8221; so common among the Indians,
stones were heated red hot and put within the hut,
and water was poured on them. The invalid, stripped
to the skin, entered, the opening was closed behind
him, and he was left to steam in the vapors.</p>
<p>When Cecil came up, the steam was pouring between
the overlapping edges of the skins, and he could hear
the young Willamette inside, chanting a low monotonous
song, an endlessly repeated invocation to his
<i>totem</i> to make him well. How he could sing or even
breathe in that stifling atmosphere was a mystery to
Cecil.</p>
<p>By and by the Willamette raised the flap that hung
over the entrance and crawled out, hot, steaming,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_178' name='page_178'></a>178</span>
perspiring at every pore. He rushed with unsteady
footsteps down to the river, only a few yards away,
and plunged into the cold water. After repeatedly
immersing himself, he waded back to the shore and
lay down to dry in the sun. The shock to his nervous
system of plunging from a hot steam-bath into ice-cold
water fresh from the snow peaks of the north
had roused all his latent vitality. He had recovered
enough to be sullen and resentful to Cecil when he
came up; and after vainly trying to talk with or help
him, the missionary left him.</p>
<p>It is characteristic of the Indian, perhaps of most
half-animal races, that their moral conduct depends
on physical feeling. Like the animal, they are good-humored,
even sportive, when all is well; like the
animal, they are sluggish and unreasoning in time of
sickness.</p>
<p>Cecil went back to the camp. He found that the
archery games were over, and that a great day of
gambling had begun. He was astonished at the
eagerness with which all the Indians flung themselves
into it. Multnomah alone took no part, and Tohomish,
visible only at the council, was not there. But
with those two exceptions, chiefs, warriors, all flung
themselves headlong into the game.</p>
<p>First, some of the leading chiefs played at &#8220;hand,&#8221;
and each tribe backed its chief. Furs, skins, weapons,
all manner of Indian wealth was heaped in piles behind
the gamblers, constituting the stakes; and they
were divided among the tribes of the winners,&mdash;each
player representing a tribe, and his winnings going,
not to himself, but to his people. This rule applied,
of course, only to the great public games; in private
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_179' name='page_179'></a>179</span>
games of &#8220;hand&#8221; each successful player kept his own
spoils.</p>
<p>Amid the monotonous chant that always accompanied
gambling, the two polished bits of bone (the
winning one marked, the other not) were passed
secretly from hand to hand. The bets were made
as to who held the marked stick and in which hand,
then a show of hands was made and the game was
lost and won.</p>
<p>From &#8220;hand&#8221; they passed to <i>ahikia</i>, a game like
that of dice, played with figured beaver teeth or
disks of ivory, which were tossed up, everything
depending on the combination of figures presented
in their fall. It was played recklessly. The Indians
were carried away by excitement. They bet anything
and everything they had. Wealthy chiefs
staked their all on the turn of the ivory disks, and
some were beggared, some enriched. Cecil noticed
in particular Mishlah the Cougar, chief of the Molallies.
He was like a man intoxicated. His huge
bestial face was all ablaze with excitement, his eyes
were glowing like coals. He had scarcely enough
intellect to understand the game, but enough combativeness
to fling himself into it body and soul. He
bet his horses and lost them; he bet his slaves and
lost again; he bet his lodges, with their rude furnishings
of mat and fur, and lost once more. Maddened,
furious, like a lion in the toils, the desperate savage
staked his wives and children on the throw of the
<i>ahikia</i>, and they were swept from him into perpetual
slavery.</p>
<p>Then he rose up and glared upon his opponents,
with his tomahawk clinched in his hand,&mdash;as if feeling
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_180' name='page_180'></a>180</span>
dimly that he had been wronged, thirsting for vengeance,
ready to strike, yet not knowing upon whom
the blow should fall. There was death in his look, and
the chiefs shrunk from him, when his eyes met Multnomah&#8217;s,
who was looking on; and the war-chief
checked and awed him with his cold glance, as a
tamer of beasts might subdue a rebellious tiger. Then
the Molallie turned and went away, raging, desperate,
a chief still, but a chief without lodge or wife or
slave.</p>
<p>The sight was painful to Cecil, and he too went
away while the game was at its height. Drawn by an
influence that he could not resist, he took the trail
that led down the bank of the river to the retreat of
Wallulah.</p>

<p>He found the sentinels by the pathway half reluctant
to let him pass, but they did not forbid
him. Evidently it was only their awe of him as the
&#8220;Great White Prophet,&#8221; to whom Multnomah had
added the dignity of an Indian sachem, that overcame
their scruples. It was with a sense of doing
wrong that he went on. &#8220;If Multnomah knew,&#8221; he
thought, &#8220;what would he do?&#8221; And brave as Cecil
was, he shuddered, thinking how deadly the wrath
of the war-chief would be, if he knew of these secret
visits to his daughter.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is an abuse of hospitality; it is clandestine,
wrong,&#8221; he thought bitterly. &#8220;And yet she is lonely,
she needs me, and I must go to her; but I will never
go again.&#8221;</p>
<p>Where he had met her before, he found her waiting
for him now, a small, graceful figure, standing in the
shadow of the wood. She heard his footsteps before
he saw her, and the melancholy features were transfigured
with joy. She stood hesitating a moment like
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_182' name='page_182'></a>182</span>
some shy creature of the forest, then sprang eagerly
forward to meet him.</p>
<p>&#8220;I knew you were coming!&#8221; she cried rapturously.
&#8220;I felt your approach long before I heard your footsteps.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How is that?&#8221; said Cecil, holding her hands and
looking down into her radiant eyes. Something of the
wild Indian mysticism flashed in them as she replied:</p>
<p>&#8220;I cannot tell; I knew it! my spirit heard your
steps long before my ears could catch the sound.
But oh!&#8221; she cried in sudden transition, her face
darkening, her eyes growing large and pathetic, &#8220;why
did you not come yesterday? I so longed for you
and you did not come. It seemed as if the day
would never end. I thought that perhaps the Indians
had killed you; I thought it might be that I should
never see you again; and all the world grew dark as
night, I felt so terribly alone. Promise me you will
never stay away so long again!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Never!&#8221; exclaimed Cecil, on the impulse of the
moment. An instant later he would have given the
world to have recalled the word.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am so glad!&#8221; she cried, clapping her hands in
girlish delight; and he could not pain her by an
explanation.</p>
<p>&#8220;After a while I will tell her how impossible it is
for me to come again,&#8221; he thought. &#8220;I cannot tell
her now.&#8221; And he seized upon every word and look
of the lovely unconscious girl, with a hunger of heart
born of eight years&#8217; starvation.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now you must come with me to my lodge; you
are my guest, and I shall entertain you. I want you
to look at my treasures.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_183' name='page_183'></a>183</span></div>
<p>Cecil went with her, wondering if they would meet
Multnomah at her lodge, and if so, what he would
say. He felt that he was doing wrong, yet so sweet
was it to be in her presence, so much did her beauty
fill the mighty craving of his nature, that it was not
possible for him to tear himself away.</p>
<p>Some fifteen minutes&#8217; walk brought them to Wallulah&#8217;s
lodge. It was a large building, made of bark
set upright against a frame-work of poles, and roofed
with cedar boards,&mdash;in its external appearance like
all Willamette lodges. Several Indian girls, neatly
dressed and of more than ordinary intelligence, were
busied in various employments about the yard. They
looked in surprise at the white man and their mistress,
but said nothing. The two entered the lodge.
Cecil muttered an exclamation of amazement as he
crossed the threshold.</p>
<p>The interior was a glow of color, a bower of richness.
Silken tapestries draped and concealed the
bark walls; the floor of trodden earth was covered
with a superbly figured carpet. It was like the hall of
some Asiatic palace. Cecil looked at Wallulah, and
her eyes sparkled with merriment at his bewildered
expression. &#8220;I knew you would be astonished,&#8221; she
cried. &#8220;Is not this as fair as anything in your own
land? No, wait till I show you another room!&#8221;</p>
<p>She led the way to an inner apartment, drew back
the tapestry that hung over the doorway, and bade
him enter.</p>
<p>Never, not even at St. James or at Versailles, had
he seen such magnificence. The rich many-hued
products of Oriental looms covered the rough walls;
the carpet was like a cushion; mirrors sparkling with
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_184' name='page_184'></a>184</span>
gems reflected his figure; luxurious divans invited to
repose. Everywhere his eye met graceful draperies
and artistically blended colors. Silk and gold combined
to make up a scene that was like a dream of
fable. Cecil&#8217;s dazzled eyes wandered over all this
splendor, then came back to Wallulah&#8217;s face again.</p>
<p>&#8220;I have seen nothing like this in my own land, not
even in the King&#8217;s palace. How came such beautiful
things here among the Indians?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;They were saved from the vessel that was wrecked.
They were my mother&#8217;s, and she had them arranged
thus. This was her lodge. It is mine now. I have
never entered any other. I have never been inside
an Indian wigwam. My mother forbade it, for fear
that I might grow like the savage occupants.&#8221;</p>
<p>Cecil knew now how she had preserved her grace
and refinement amid her fierce and squalid surroundings.
Again her face changed and the wistful look
came back. Her wild delicate nature seemed to
change every moment, to break out in a hundred
varying impulses.</p>
<p>&#8220;I love beautiful things,&#8221; she said, drawing a fold
of tapestry against her cheek. &#8220;They seem half
human. I love to be among them and feel their
influence. These were my mother&#8217;s, and it seems
as if part of her life was in them. Sometimes, after
she died, I used to shut my eyes and put my cheek
against the soft hangings and try to think it was the
touch of her hand; or I would read from her favorite
poets and try to think that I heard her repeating
them to me again!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Read!&#8221; exclaimed Cecil; &#8220;then you have books?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, yes, I will show you all my treasures.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_185' name='page_185'></a>185</span></div>
<p>She went into another apartment and returned
with a velvet case and a richly enchased casket.
She opened the case and took out several rolls of
parchment.</p>
<p>&#8220;Here they are, my dear old friends, that have
told me so many beautiful things.&#8221;</p>
<p>Cecil unrolled them with a scholar&#8217;s tenderness.
Their touch thrilled him; it was touching again some
familiar hand parted from years ago. The parchments
were covered with strange characters, in a language
entirely unknown to him. The initial letters
were splendidly illuminated, the margins ornamented
with elaborate designs. Cecil gazed on the scrolls,
as one who loves music but who is ignorant of its
technicalities might look at a sonata of Beethoven or
an opera of Wagner, and be moved by its suggested
melodies.</p>
<p>&#8220;I cannot read it,&#8221; he said a little sadly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sometime I will teach you,&#8221; she replied; &#8220;and
you shall teach me your own language, and we will
talk in it instead of this wretched Indian tongue.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Tell me something about it now,&#8221; asked Cecil,
still gazing at the unknown lines.</p>
<p>&#8220;Not now, there is so much else to talk about;
but I will to-morrow.&#8221;</p>
<p>To-morrow! The word pierced him like a knife.
For him, a missionary among barbarians, for her, the
betrothed of a savage chief, the morrow could bring
only parting and woe; the sweet, fleeting present
was all they could hope for. For them there could
be no to-morrow. Wallulah, however, did not observe
his dejection. She had opened the casket, and
now placed it between them as they sat together on
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_186' name='page_186'></a>186</span>
the divan. One by one, she took out the contents
and displayed them. A magnificent necklace of diamonds,
another of pearls; rings, brooches, jewelled
bracelets, flashed their splendor on him. Totally
ignorant of their great value, she showed them only
with a true woman&#8217;s love of beautiful things, showed
them as artlessly as if they were but pretty shells or
flowers.</p>
<p>&#8220;Are they not bright?&#8221; she would say, holding
them up to catch the light. &#8220;How they sparkle!&#8221;</p>
<p>One she took up a little reluctantly. It was an
opal, a very fine one. She held it out, turning it in
the light, so that he might see the splendid jewel
glow and pale.</p>
<p>&#8220;Is it not lovely?&#8221; she said; &#8220;like sun-tints on
the snow. But my mother said that in her land it is
called the stone of misfortune. It is beautiful, but it
brings trouble with it.&#8221;</p>
<p>He saw her fingers tremble nervously as they held
it, and she dropped it from them hurriedly into the
casket, as if it were some bright poisonous thing she
dreaded to touch.</p>
<p>After a while, when Cecil had sufficiently admired
the stones, she put them back into the casket and
took it and the parchments away. She came back
with her flute, and seating herself, looked at him
closely.</p>
<p>&#8220;You are sad; there are heavy thoughts on your
mind. How is that? He who brings me sunshine
must not carry a shadow on his own brow. Why are
you troubled?&#8221;</p>
<p>The trouble was that he realized now, and was
compelled to acknowledge to himself, that he loved
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_187' name='page_187'></a>187</span>
this gentle, clinging girl, with a passionate love; that
he yearned to take her in his arms and shelter her
from the terrible savagery before her; and that he
felt it could not, must not be.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is but little,&#8221; he replied. &#8220;Every heart has
its burden, and perhaps I have mine. It is the lot
of man.&#8221;</p>
<p>She looked at him with a vague uneasiness; her
susceptible nature responded dimly to the tumultuous
emotions that he was trying by force of will to shut
up in his own heart.</p>
<p>&#8220;Trouble? Oh, do I not know how bitter it is!
Tell me, what do your people do when they have
trouble? Do they cut off their hair and blacken their
faces, as the Indians do, when they lose one they love?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, they would scorn to do anything so degrading.
He is counted bravest who makes the least
display of grief and yet always cherishes a tender
remembrance of the dead.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;So would I. My mother forbade me to cut off
my hair or blacken my face when she died, and so I
did not, though some of the Indians thought me
bad for not doing so. And your people are not
afraid to talk of the dead?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Most certainly not. Why should we be? We
know that they are in a better world, and their memories
are dear to us. It is very sweet sometimes to
talk of them.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But the Willamettes never talk of their dead, for
fear they may hear their names spoken and come
back. Why should they dread their coming back?
Ah, if my mother only <i>would</i> come back! How I
used to long and pray for it!&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_188' name='page_188'></a>188</span></div>
<p>Cecil began to talk to her about the love and
goodness of God. If he could only see her sheltered
in the Divine compassion, he could trust her to slip
from him into the unknown darkness of her future.
She listened earnestly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Your words are good,&#8221; she said in her quaint
phraseology; &#8220;and if trouble comes to me again I
shall remember them. But I am very happy now.&#8221;</p>
<p>The warmth and thankfulness of her glance sent
through him a great thrill of blended joy and pain.</p>
<p>&#8220;You forget,&#8221; he said, forcing himself to be calm,
&#8220;that you are soon to leave your home and become
the wife of Snoqualmie.&#8221;</p>
<p>Wallulah raised her hand as if to ward off a blow,
her features quivering with pain. She tried to reply,
but for an instant the words faltered on her lips.
He saw it, and a fierce delight leaped up in his heart.
&#8220;She does not love him, it is I whom she cares for,&#8221;
he thought; and then he thrust the thought down in
indignant self-reproach.</p>
<p>&#8220;I do not care for Snoqualmie; I once thought I
did, but&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>She hesitated, the quick color flushed her face; for
the first time she seemed in part, though not altogether,
aware of why she had changed.</p>
<p>For an instant Cecil felt as if he must speak; but
the consequences rose before him while the words
were almost on his lips. If he spoke and won her
love, Multnomah would force her into a marriage with
Snoqualmie just the same; and if the iron despot
were to consent and give her to Cecil, the result would
be a bloody war with Snoqualmie.</p>
<p>&#8220;I cannot, I must not,&#8221; thought Cecil. He rose
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_189' name='page_189'></a>189</span>
to his feet; his one impulse was to get away, to fight
out the battle with himself. Wallulah grew pale.</p>
<p>&#8220;You are going?&#8221; she said, rising also. &#8220;Something
in your face tells me you are not coming back,&#8221;
and she looked at him with strained, sad, wistful
eyes.</p>
<p>He stood hesitating, torn by conflicting emotions,
not knowing what to do.</p>
<p>&#8220;If you do not come back, I shall die,&#8221; she said
simply.</p>
<p>As they stood thus, her flute slipped from her relaxed
fingers and fell upon the floor. He picked it
up and gave it to her, partly through the born instinct
of the gentleman, which no familiarity with barbarism
can entirely crush out, partly through the tendency in
time of intense mental strain to relieve the mind by
doing any little thing.</p>
<p>She took it, lifted it to her lips, and, still looking at
him, began to play. The melody, strange, untaught,
artless as the song of a wood-bird, was infinitely sorrowful
and full of longing. Her very life seemed to
breathe through the music in fathomless yearning.
Cecil understood the plea, and the tears rushed unbidden
into his eyes. All his heart went out to her in
pitying tenderness and love; and yet he dared not
trust himself to speak.</p>
<p>&#8220;Promise to come back,&#8221; said the music, while her
dark eyes met his; &#8220;promise to come back. You are
my one friend, my light, my all; do not leave me to
perish in the dark. I shall die without you, I shall
die, I shall die!&#8221;</p>
<p>Could any man resist the appeal? Could Cecil, of
all men, thrilling through all his sensitive and ardent
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_190' name='page_190'></a>190</span>
nature to the music, thrilling still more to a mighty
and resistless love?</p>
<p>&#8220;I will come back,&#8221; he said, and parted from her;
he dared not trust himself to say another word. But
the parting was not so abrupt as to prevent his seeing
the swift breaking-forth of light upon the melancholy
face that was becoming so beautiful to him and so
dear.</p>

<p>The next day the Indians had a great hunt. A
circle of men on foot and on horseback was
drawn around a large tract of forest on the western
side of the Willamette River. Gradually, with much
shouting, hallooing, and beating of bushes, the circle
closed upon the game within it, like the folds of a
mighty serpent.</p>
<p>There was a prodigious slaughter, a mad scene of
butchery, in which the Indians exulted like fiends.
Late in the afternoon they returned to camp, stained
with blood and loaded with the spoils of the chase.
Snoqualmie distinguished himself by killing a large
bear, and its claws, newly severed and bleeding,
were added to his already ample necklace of similar
trophies.</p>
<p>Cecil remained in the almost deserted camp. He
tried in vain to talk with the few chiefs who had not
gone out to join in the hunt. Missionary work was
utterly impossible that day. Wallulah and the problem
of his love filled his thoughts. His mind, aroused
and burning, searched and analyzed the question
upon every side.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_192' name='page_192'></a>192</span></div>
<p>Should he tell Multnomah of Snoqualmie&#8217;s cruelty,
representing his unfitness to be the husband of the
gentle Wallulah?</p>
<p>To the stern war-chief that very cruelty would be
an argument in Snoqualmie&#8217;s favor. Should he himself
become a suitor for her hand? He knew full
well that Multnomah would reject him with disdain;
or, were he to consent, it would involve the Willamettes
in a war with the haughty and vindictive Cayuse.
Finally, should he attempt to fly with her to some
other land? Impossible. All the tribes of the northwest
were held in the iron grip of Multnomah. They
could never escape; and even if they could, the good
he had done among the Indians, the good he hoped
would grow from generation to generation, would be
all destroyed if it were told among them that he who
claimed to come to them with a message from God
had ended by stealing the chief&#8217;s daughter. And had
he a right to love any one?&mdash;had he a right to love
at all? God had sent him to do a work among the
Indians; was it not wicked for him to so much as
look either to the right or to the left till that work
was done?</p>
<p>Amid this maze of perplexities, his tense, agonized
soul sought in vain for some solution, some conclusion.
At times he sat in his lodge and brooded over these
things till he seemed wrought up almost to madness,
till his form trembled with excitement, and the old
pain at his heart grew sharp and deadly.</p>
<p>Then again, trying to shake it off, he went out
among the few Indians who were left in the camp and
attempted to do missionary work; but enthusiasm
was lacking, the glow and tenderness was gone from
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_193' name='page_193'></a>193</span>
his words, the grand devotion that had inspired him
so long failed him at last. He was no longer a saintly
apostle to the Indians; he was only a human lover,
torn by stormy human doubts and fears.</p>
<p>Even the Indians felt that some intangible change
had come over him, and as they listened their hearts
no longer responded to his eloquence; they felt somehow
that the life was gone from his words. He saw
it too, and it gave him a keen pang.</p>
<p>He realized that the energy and concentration of
his character was gone, that a girl&#8217;s beauty had drawn
him aside from the mission on which God had
sent him.</p>
<p>&#8220;I will go and see her. I will, without letting her
know that I love her, give her to understand my
position and her own. She shall see how impossible
it is for us ever to be aught to each other. And I
shall urge her to cling to God and walk in the path
he has appointed for her, while I go on in mine.&#8221;</p>
<p>So thinking, he left his lodge that evening and
took the path to Wallulah&#8217;s home.</p>
<p>Some distance from the encampment he met an
Indian funeral procession. The young Willamette
runner had died that morning, and now they were
bearing him to the river, down which a canoe was to
waft the body and the mourners to the nearest <i>mimaluse</i>
island. The corpse was swathed in skins and
tied around with thongs; the father bore it on his
shoulder, for the dead had been but a slender lad.
Behind them came the mother and a few Indian
women. As they passed, the father chanted a rude
lament.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, Mox-mox, my son, why did you go away and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_194' name='page_194'></a>194</span>
leave our wigwam empty? You were not weak nor
sickly, and your life was young. Why did you go?
Oh, Mox-mox, dead, dead, dead!&#8221;</p>
<p>Then the women took up the doleful refrain,&mdash;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, Mox-mox, dead, dead, dead!&#8221;</p>
<p>Then the old man again,&mdash;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, Mox-mox, the sun was warm and food was
plenty, yet you went away; and when we reach out
for you, you are not there. Oh Mox-mox, dead,
dead, dead!&#8221;</p>
<p>Then the women again,&mdash;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, Mox-mox, dead, dead, dead!&#8221;</p>
<p>And so it went on, till they were embarked and the
canoe bore them from sight and hearing. Down on
some <i>mimaluse</i> island or rocky point, they would
stretch the corpse out in a canoe, with the bow and
arrows and fishing spear used in life beside it; then
turn over it another canoe like a cover, and so leave
the dead to his long sleep.</p>
<p>The sight gave an added bitterness to Cecil&#8217;s
meditations.</p>
<p>&#8220;After all,&#8221; he thought, &#8220;life is so short,&mdash;a shadow
fleeting onward to the night,&mdash;and love is so sweet!
Why not open my heart to the bliss it brings? The
black ending comes so soon! Why not fling all
thought of consequences to the winds, and gather into
my arms the love that is offered me? why not know
its warmth and thrill for one golden moment, even
though that moment ends in death?&#8221;</p>
<p>The blood rushed wildly through his veins, but he
resolutely put down the temptation. No, he would
be faithful, he would not allow himself even to think
of such a thing.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_195' name='page_195'></a>195</span></div>
<p>Reluctantly, as before, the sentinels made way for
him and he went on through the wood to the trysting-place,
for such it had come to be. She was waiting.
But there was no longer the glad illumination
of face, the glad springing forward to meet him. She
advanced shyly, a delicate color in her cheek, a tremulous
grace in her manner, that he had not observed
before; the consciousness of love had come to her
and made her a woman. Never had she seemed so
fair to Cecil; yet his resolution did not falter.</p>
<p>&#8220;I have come, you see,&mdash;come to tell you that I
can come no more, and to talk with you about your
future.&#8221;</p>
<p>Her face grew very pale.</p>
<p>&#8220;Are you going away?&#8221; she asked sorrowfully,
&#8220;and shall I never see you again?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I cannot come back,&#8221; he replied gently. The
sight of her suffering cut him to the heart.</p>
<p>&#8220;It has been much to see you,&#8221; he continued,
while she stood before him, looking downward, without
reply. &#8220;It has been like meeting one of my own
people. I shall never forget you.&#8221;</p>
<p>She raised her head and strove to answer, but the
words died on her lips. How he loathed himself,
talking so smoothly to her while he hungered to take
her in his arms and tell her how he loved her!</p>
<p>Again he spoke.</p>
<p>&#8220;I hope you will be happy with Snoqualmie,
and&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>She lifted her eyes with a sudden light flashing in
their black depths.</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you want me to hate him? Never speak his
name to me again!&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_196' name='page_196'></a>196</span></div>
<p>&#8220;He is to be your husband; nay, it is the wish of
your father, and the great sachems approve it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Can the sachems put love in my heart? Can
the sachems make my heart receive him as its lord?
Ah, this bitter custom of the father giving his daughter
to whomsoever he will, as if she were a dog! And
your lips sanction it!&#8221;</p>
<p>Her eyes were full of tears. Scarcely realizing
what he did, he tried to take her hand. The slender
fingers shrank from his and were drawn away.</p>
<p>&#8220;I do not sanction it, it is a bitter custom; but it
is to be, and I only wished to smooth your pathway.
I want to say or do something that will help you
when I am gone.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you know what it would be for me to be an
Indian&#8217;s wife? To cut the wood, and carry the
water, and prepare the food,&mdash;that would be sweet
to do for one I loved. But to toil amid dirt and
filth for a savage whom I could only abhor, to feel
myself growing coarse and squalid with my surroundings,&mdash;I
could not live!&#8221;</p>
<p>She shuddered as she spoke, as if the very thought
was horrible.</p>
<p>&#8220;You hate this degraded Indian life as much as
I do, and yet it is the life you would push me into,&#8221;
she continued, in a tone of mournful heart-broken
reproach. It stung him keenly.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is not the life I would push you into. God
knows I would give my life to take one thorn from
yours,&#8221; The mad longing within him rushed into
his voice in spite of himself, making it thrill with a
passionate tenderness that brought the color back
into her pallid cheek. &#8220;But I cannot remain,&#8221; he
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_197' name='page_197'></a>197</span>
went on, &#8220;I dare not; all that I can do is to say
something that may help you in the future.&#8221;</p>
<p>She looked at him with dilated eyes full of pain and
bewilderment.</p>
<p>&#8220;I have no future if you go away. Why must
you go? What will be left me after you are gone?
Think how long I was here alone after my mother
died, with no one to understand me, no one to
talk to. Then you came, and I was happy. It was
like light shining in the darkness; now it goes out
and I can never hope again. Why must you go away
and leave Wallulah in the dark?&#8221;</p>
<p>There was a childlike plaintiveness and simplicity
in her tone; and she came close to him, looking up
in his face with wistful, pleading eyes, the beautiful
face wan and drawn with bewilderment and pain, yet
never so beautiful as now.</p>
<p>Cecil felt the unspeakable cruelty of his attitude
toward her, and his face grew white as death in an
awful struggle between love and duty. But he felt
that he must leave her or be disloyal to his God.</p>
<p>&#8220;I do not wish to go away. But God has called
me to a great work, and I must do it. I dare not
turn aside. You cannot know how dear your presence
is to me, or how bitter it is for me to part from
you. But our parting must be, else the work I have
done among the tribes will be scattered to the winds
and the curse of God will be on me as a false and
fallen prophet.&#8221;</p>
<p>He spoke with a kind of fierceness, striving blindly
to battle down the mad longing within, and his tones
had a harshness that he was too agitated to notice.
She drew back involuntarily. There came into her
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_198' name='page_198'></a>198</span>
face a dignity he had never seen before. She was
but a recluse and a girl, but she was of royal lineage
by right of both her parents, and his words had roused
a spirit worthy the daughter of Multnomah.</p>
<p>&#8220;Am I a weight on you? Are you afraid I will
bring a curse upon you? Do not fear, I shall no
longer ask you to stay. Wallulah shall take herself
out of your life.&#8221;</p>
<p>She gave him a look full of despair, as if seeing all
hope go from her forever; then she said simply,
&#8220;Farewell,&#8221; and turned away.</p>
<p>But in spite of her dignity there was an anguish
written on her sweet pale face that he could not
resist. All his strength of resolve, all his conviction
of duty, crumbled into dust as she turned away; and
he was conscious only that he loved her, that he
could not let her go.</p>
<p>How it happened he never knew, but she was
clasped in his arms, his kisses were falling on brow
and cheek in a passionate outburst that could be
kept back no longer. At first, she trembled in his
arms and shrank away from him; then she nestled
close, as if sheltering herself in the love that was
hers at last. After awhile she lifted a face over
which a shadow of pain yet lingered.</p>
<p>&#8220;But you said I would bring you a curse; you
feared&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>He stopped her with a caress.</p>
<p>&#8220;Even curses would be sweet if they came through
you. Forget what I said, remember only that I love
you!&#8221;</p>
<p>And she was content.</p>
<p>Around them the twilight darkened into night; the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_199' name='page_199'></a>199</span>
hours came and went unheeded by these two, wrapped
in that golden love-dream which for a moment brings
Eden back again to this gray old earth, all desolate as
it is with centuries of woe and tears.</p>
<p>But while they talked there was on him a vague
dread, an indefinable misgiving, a feeling that he was
disloyal to his mission, disloyal to her; that their love
could have but one ending, and that a dark one.</p>
<p>Still he strove hard to forget everything, to shut out
all the world,&mdash;drinking to the full the bliss of the
present, blinding his eyes to the pain of the future.</p>
<p>But after they parted, when her presence was withdrawn
and he was alone, he felt like a man faithless
and dishonored; like a prophet who had bartered the
salvation of the people to whom he had been sent, in
exchange for a woman&#8217;s kisses, which could bring him
only disgrace and death.</p>
<p>As he went back to the camp in the stillness of
midnight, he was startled by a distant roar, and saw
through the tree-tops flames bursting from the far-off
crater of Mount Hood. The volcano was beginning
one of its periodical outbursts. But to Cecil&#8217;s mind,
imbued with the gloomy supernaturalism of early New
England, and unconsciously to himself, tinged in later
years with the superstition of the Indians among whom
he had lived so long, that ominous roar, those flames
leaping up into the black skies of night, seemed a
sign of the wrath of God.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VII.</h2>
<h3>ORATOR AGAINST ORATOR.</h3>
</div>
<p style='margin-left:2.0em; margin-right:2.0em; '>The gravity, fixed attention, and decorum of these sons of the forest was calculated to make for them a most favorable impression.&mdash;<span style='font-variant:small-caps'>Gray:</span> <i>History of Oregon</i>.</p>
<hr style='border:none; height:1em;' />
<p>The next day all the Indians were gathered around
the council grove. Multnomah presided, and
every sachem was in his place.</p>
<p>There was to be a trial of eloquence,&mdash;a tourney
of orators, to see which tribe had the best. Only one,
the most eloquent of each tribe, was to speak; and
Multnomah was to decide who was victor. The
mother of Wallulah had introduced the custom, and
it had become popular among the Indians.</p>
<p>Cecil was in his place among the chiefs, with worn
face and abstracted air; Snoqualmie was present, with
hawk-like glance and imperious mien; there was Mishlah,
with his sullen and brutal features; there, too,
wrapped closely in his robe of fur, sat Tohomish,
brooding, gloomy,&mdash;the wild empire&#8217;s mightiest master
of eloquence, and yet the most repulsive figure
of them all.</p>
<p>The Indians were strangely quiet that morning;
the hush of a superstitious awe was upon them. The
smoking mountains, Hood and Adams as the white
man calls them, Au-poo-tah and Au-ka-ken in the
Indian tongue, were becoming active of late. The
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_201' name='page_201'></a>201</span>
previous night flame had been seen bursting from the
top of Mount Hood and thick black smoke still puffed
upward from it, and on Mount Adams rested a heavy
cloud of volcanic vapors. Were the mountains angry?
Aged men told how in the old time there had been a
terrible outburst of flame and ashes from Mount Hood;
a rain of fire and stones had fallen over all the Willamette
valley; the very earth had trembled at the
great mountain&#8217;s wrath.</p>
<p>As the lower animals feel in the air the signs of a
coming storm, so these savages felt, by some kindred
intuition, that a mysterious convulsion of Nature was
at hand. They talked in low tones, they were subdued
in manner; any one coming suddenly upon them
would have been impressed by the air of uneasiness
and apprehension that everywhere prevailed. But the
chiefs were stoical, and Multnomah impassive as ever.</p>
<p>Could it have been that the stormy influences at
work in Nature lent energy to the orators that day?
They were unusually animated, at least for Indians,
though a white man would have found them intolerably
bombastic. Each speech was a boastful eulogy
of the speaker&#8217;s tribe, and an exaggerated account
of the wonderful exploits of its warriors.</p>
<p>This was rather dangerous ground; for all the
tribes had been at enmity in days gone by, and some
of their most renowned victories had been won over
each other. Every one took it in good part, however,
except Mishlah. When We-math, chief of the Klamaths,
recounting the exploits of his race, told how
in ancient times they had lorded it over the Mollalies,
Mishlah glared at him as if tempted to leap upon him
and strike him down. Fortunately the orator passed
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_202' name='page_202'></a>202</span>
on to other things, and the wrath of the Mollalie chief
gradually cooled.</p>
<p>Then came Cecil. It was a grand opening. He
could speak of his own people, of their ancient savagery
and present splendor, and show how the gospel
of love and justice had been the cause of their
elevation. Then would come the appeal to the Indians
to accept this faith as their own and share in
its uplifting power. It was a magnificent opportunity,
the opportunity of a life-time.</p>
<p>But the mental conflict he had just passed through
had rent his mind like a volcanic upheaval. It possessed
no longer the intense concentration which had
been the source of its strength. Tenderness, benevolence,
missionary zeal, were still there, but no longer
sovereign. Other passions divided his heart; a hopeless
and burning love consumed his being.</p>
<p>He spoke, but the fire was gone from his delivery
and the vividness from his imagination. His eloquence
was not what it had been; his heart was no
longer in his work, and his oration was a failure.</p>
<p>Even the Indians noticed that something was lacking
in his oratory, and it no longer moved them as it
had done. Cecil realized it, and strove to speak with
more energy, but in vain; he could not arouse himself;
and it was with a consciousness of failure that he
brought his speech to a close and resumed his seat.</p>
<p>To a man of his morbid conscientiousness only one
conclusion was possible.</p>
<p>&#8220;God sent me to proclaim salvation to these children
of darkness,&#8221; he thought, &#8220;and I have turned
aside to fill my heart with a woman&#8217;s love. His wrath
is on me. He has taken his spirit from me. I am
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_203' name='page_203'></a>203</span>
a thing rejected and accursed, and this people will go
down to death because I have failed in my mission.&#8221;</p>
<p>While he sat absorbed in these bitter, self-accusing
thoughts, the speaking went on. Wau-ca-cus the
Klickitat made a strong &#8220;talk,&#8221; picturesque in Indian
metaphor, full of energy. But the chief that followed
surpassed him. Orator caught fire from orator;
thoughts not unworthy a civilized audience were
struck out by the intensity of the emulation; speakers
rose to heights which they had never reached before,
which they were destined never to reach again.
In listening to and admiring their champions, the
tribes forgot the smoking mountains and the feeling
of apprehension that had oppressed them. At length
Snoqualmie made a speech breathing his own daring
spirit in every word. It went immeasurably beyond
the others; it was the climax of all the darkly splendid
eloquence of the day.</p>
<p>No, not of all. From his place among the chiefs
rose a small and emaciated figure; the blanket that
had muffled his face was thrown aside, and the tribes
looked on the mis-shapen and degraded features of
Tohomish the Pine Voice. He stood silent at first,
his eyes bent on the ground, like a man in a trance.
For a moment the spectators forgot the wonderful
eloquence of the man in his ignoble appearance.
What could he do against Wau-ca-cus the Klickitat
and Snoqualmie the Cayuse, whose sonorous utterances
still rang in their ears, whose majestic presence
still filled their minds!</p>
<p>&#8220;The Willamettes are beaten at last,&mdash;the Willamette
speakers can no more be called the best,&#8221; was
the one exultant thought of the allies, and the Willamettes
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_204' name='page_204'></a>204</span>
trembled for the fame of their orators. Back
in the shadow of the cottonwoods, an old Willamette
warrior put an arrow on the string and bent his bow
unseen on Tohomish.</p>
<p>&#8220;He cannot beat them, and it shall never be said
that Tohomish failed,&#8221; he muttered. At that moment,
even as death hung over him, the orator&#8217;s voice was
heard beginning his &#8220;talk;&#8221; and the warrior&#8217;s hand
fell, the bent bow was relaxed, the arrow dropped
from the string. For with the first accents of that soft
and lingering voice the tribes were thrilled as with the
beginning of music.</p>
<p>The orator&#8217;s head was still bent down, his manner
abstracted; he spoke of the legends and the glories of
the Willamette tribe, but spoke of them as if that tribe
belonged to the past, as if it had perished from the
earth, and he was telling the tale of a great dead race.
His tones were melodious but indescribably mournful.
When at length he lifted his face, his eyes shone with
a misty light, and his brutal features were illuminated
with a weird enthusiasm. A shudder went through
the vast and motley assembly. No boastful rant was
this, but a majestic story of the past, the story of a
nation gone forever. It was the death-song of the
Willamettes, solemnly rendered by the last and greatest
orator of the race.</p>
<p>At length he spoke of Multnomah and of the power
of the confederacy in his time, but spoke of it as of old
time, seen dimly through the lapse of years. Then,
when as it seemed he was about to go on and tell how
this power came to fall, he hesitated; the words faltered
on his lips; he suddenly broke off, took his
seat, and drew his robe again over his face.</p>

<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_205' name='page_205'></a>205</span></div>
<p>The effect was indescribable. The portentous nature
of the whole speech needed only that last touch
of mystery. It sent through every heart a wild and
awesome thrill, as at the shadow of approaching
destiny.</p>
<p>The multitude were silent; the spell of the prophet&#8217;s
lofty and mournful eloquence still lingered over
them. Multnomah rose. With him rested the decision
as to who was the greatest orator. But the proud
old war-chief knew that all felt that Tohomish had far
surpassed his competitors, and he was resolved that
not his lips but the voice of the tribes should proclaim
their choice.</p>
<p>&#8220;Multnomah was to decide who has spoken best,
but he leaves the decision with you. You have heard
them all. Declare who is the greatest, and your word
shall be Multnomah&#8217;s word.&#8221;</p>
<p>There was an instant&#8217;s silence; then in a murmur
like the rush of the sea came back the voice of the
multitude.</p>
<p>&#8220;Tohomish! Tohomish! he is greatest!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He is greatest,&#8221; said Multnomah. But Tohomish,
sitting there dejectedly, seemed neither to see nor
hear.</p>
<p>&#8220;To-morrow,&#8221; said the war-chief, &#8220;while the sun
is new, the chiefs will meet in council and the great
talk shall be ended. And after it ends, Multnomah&#8217;s
daughter will be given to Snoqualmie, and Multnomah
will bestow a rich <i>potlatch</i> [a giving of gifts] on the
people. And then all will be done.&#8221;</p>
<p>The gathering broke up. Gradually, as the Indians
gazed on the smoking mountains, the excitement produced
by the oratory they had just heard wore off.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_206' name='page_206'></a>206</span>
Only Tohomish&#8217;s sombre eloquence, so darkly in
unison with the menacing aspect of Nature, yet lingered
in every mind. They were frightened and
startled, apprehensive of something to come. Legends,
superstitious lore of by-gone time connected
with the &#8220;smoking mountains,&#8221; were repeated that
afternoon wherever little groups of Indians had met
together. Through all these gathered tribes ran a
dread yet indefinable whisper of apprehension, like
the first low rustle of the leaves that foreruns the
coming storm.</p>
<p>Over the valley Mount Adams towered, wrapped in
dusky cloud; and from Mount Hood streamed intermittent
bursts of smoke and gleams of fire that grew
plainer as the twilight fell. Louder, as the hush of
evening deepened, came the sullen roar from the
crater of Mount Hood. Below the crater, the ice-fields
that had glistened in unbroken whiteness the
previous day were now furrowed with wide black
streaks, from which the vapor of melting snow and
burning lava ascended in dense wreaths. Men wiser
than these ignorant savages would have said that
some terrible convulsion was at hand.</p>
<p>Multnomah&#8217;s announcement in the council was a
dreadful blow to Cecil, though he had expected it. His
first thought was of a personal appeal to the chief, but
one glance at the iron features of the autocrat told him
that it would be a hopeless undertaking. No appeal
could turn Multnomah from his purpose. For Cecil,
such an undertaking might be death; it certainly
would be contemptuous refusal, and would call down
on Wallulah the terrible wrath before which the
bravest sachem quailed.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_207' name='page_207'></a>207</span></div>
<p>Cecil left the grove with the other chiefs and found
his way to his lodge. There he flung himself down
on his face upon his couch of furs. The Indian
woman, his old nurse, who still clung to him, was
absent, and for some time he was alone. After a
while the flap that hung over the entrance was lifted,
and some one came in with the noiseless tread of the
Indian. Cecil, lying in a maze of bitter thought,
became aware of the presence of another, and raised
his head. The Shoshone renegade stood beside him.
His gaze rested compassionately on Cecil&#8217;s sad, worn
face.</p>
<p>&#8220;What is it?&#8221; he asked. &#8220;Your words were slow
and heavy to-day. There was a weight on your spirit;
what is it? You said that we were friends, so I came
to ask if I could help.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You are good, and like a brother,&#8221; replied Cecil,
gently, &#8220;but I cannot tell you my trouble. Yet
this much I can tell,&#8221;&mdash;and he sat upon the couch,
his whole frame trembling with excitement. &#8220;I
have sinned a grievous sin, therefore the Great Spirit
took away the words from my lips to-day. My heart
has become evil, and God has punished me.&#8221;</p>
<p>It was a relief to his over-burdened conscience to
say those harsh things of himself, yet the relief was
bitter. Over the bronzed face of the Indian came an
expression of deep pity.</p>
<p>&#8220;The white man tears himself with his own claws
like a wounded beast, but it does not give him peace.
Has he done evil? Then let him remember what he
has so often told the Indians: &#8216;Forsake evil, turn
from sin, and the Great Spirit will forgive.&#8217; Let my
white brother do this, and it will be well with him.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_208' name='page_208'></a>208</span></div>
<p>He gazed at Cecil an instant longer; then, with a
forbearance that more civilized men do not always
show, he left the lodge without another word.</p>
<p>But what he said had its effect. Through Cecil&#8217;s
veins leaped the impulse of a sudden resolve,&mdash;a
resolve that was both triumph and agony. He fell on
his knees beside the couch.</p>
<p>&#8220;Thou hast shown me my duty by the lips of the
Indian, and I will perform it. I will tear this forbidden
love from my heart. Father, help me. Once before
I resolved to do this and failed. Help me that I
fail not now. Give me strength. Give me the
mastery over the flesh, O God! Help me to put
this temptation from me. Help me to fulfil my
mission.&#8221;</p>
<p>The struggle was long and doubtful, but the victory
was won at last. When Cecil arose from his knees,
there was the same set and resolute look upon his
face that was there the morning he entered the wilderness,
leaving friends and home behind him forever,&mdash;the
look that some martyr of old might have
worn, putting from him the clinging arms of wife or
child, going forth to the dungeon and the stake.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is done,&#8221; murmured the white lips. &#8220;I have
put her from me. My mission to the Indians alone
fills my heart. But God help her! God help her!&#8221;</p>
<p>For the hardest part of it all was that he sacrificed
her as well as himself.</p>
<p>&#8220;It must be,&#8221; he thought; &#8220;I must give her up. I
will go now and tell her; then I will never look upon
her face again. But oh! what will become of her?&#8221;</p>
<p>And his long fingers were clinched as in acutest
pain. But his sensitive nerves, his intense susceptibilities
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_209' name='page_209'></a>209</span>
were held in abeyance by a will that, once
roused, was strong even unto death.</p>
<p>He went out. It was dark. Away to the east Mount
Hood lifted its blazing crater into the heavens like a
gigantic torch, and the roar of the eruption came
deep and hoarse through the stillness of night. Once,
twice it seemed to Cecil that the ground trembled
slightly under his feet. The Indians were huddled in
groups watching the burning crest of the volcano.
As the far-off flickering light fell on their faces, it
showed them to be full of abject fear.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is like the end of the world,&#8221; thought Cecil.
&#8220;Would that it were; then she and I might die
together.&#8221;</p>
<p>He left the camp and took the trail through the
wood to the trysting-place; for, late as it was, he
knew that she awaited him.</p>

<p>The grim sentinels by the pathway, who had been
so reluctant to let Cecil pass the day before, were
still more reluctant this evening. One of them planted
himself in the trail directly in front of Cecil, and did
not offer to let him go on, but stood sullenly blocking
the way. Cecil touched the warrior&#8217;s arm and bade
him stand aside. For an instant it seemed that he
would refuse, but his superstitious respect for the white
<i>tomanowos</i> overcame his obstinacy,&mdash;and he stepped
unwillingly back.</p>
<p>But as Cecil went on he felt, and felt rightly, that
they would not let him pass again,&mdash;that the last act,
be it what it might, in his love drama, was drawing
to a close.</p>
<p>A few moments&#8217; walk, and he saw in the dark the
little figure awaiting him under the trees. She came
slowly forward to meet him. He saw that her face
was very pale, her eyes large and full of woe. She
gave him her hands; they felt like ice. He bent over
her and kissed her with quivering lips.</p>
<p>&#8220;Poor child,&#8221; he said, putting his arms around her
slender form and drawing it close in his embrace,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_211' name='page_211'></a>211</span>
&#8220;how can I ever tell you what I have to tell you
to-night!&#8221;</p>
<p>She did not respond to his caress. At length,
looking up in a lifeless, stricken way, she spoke in a
mechanical voice, a voice that did not sound like
her own,&mdash;</p>
<p>&#8220;I know it already. My father came and told me
that to-morrow I must&mdash;&#8221; She shuddered; her voice
broke; then she threw her arms around his neck and
clung to him passionately. &#8220;But they can never tear
me away from you; never, never!&#8221;</p>
<p>How could he tell her that he came to put her
away from him, that he came to bid her farewell?
He clasped her the tighter in his arms. For an
instant his mind swept all the chances of flight with
her, only to realize their utter hopelessness; then he
remembered that even to think of such a thing was
treachery to the resolves he had just made. He
shook from head to foot with stormy emotion.</p>
<p>She lifted her head from his breast, where it was
pillowed.</p>
<p>&#8220;Let us get horses or a canoe, and fly to-night to
the desert or the sea,&mdash;anywhere, anywhere, only to
be away from here! Let us take the trail you came
on, and find our way to your people.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Alas,&#8221; replied Cecil, &#8220;how could we escape?
Every tribe, far and near, is tributary to your father.
The runners would rouse them as soon as we were
missed. The swiftest riders would be on our trail;
ambuscades would lurk for us in every thicket; we
could never escape; and even if we should, a whole
continent swarming with wild tribes lies between us
and my land.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_212' name='page_212'></a>212</span></div>
<p>She looked at him in anguish, with dim eyes, and
her arms slipped from around his neck.</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you no longer love Wallulah? Something
tells me that you would not wish to fly with me, even
if we could escape. There is something you have not
told me.&#8221;</p>
<p>Clasping her closely to him, he told her how he
felt it was the will of God that they must part. God
had sent him on a sacred mission, and he dared not
turn aside. Either her love or the redemption of the
tribes of the Wauna must be given up; and for their
sake love must be sacrificed.</p>
<p>&#8220;To-day God took away the words from my lips
and the spirit from my heart. My soul was lead. I
felt like one accursed. Then it came to me that it
was because I turned aside from my mission to love
you. We must part. Our ways diverge. I must
walk my own pathway alone wheresoever it leads me.
God commands, and I must obey.&#8221;</p>
<p>The old rapt look came back, the old set, determined
expression which showed that that delicate
organization could grow as strong as granite in its
power to endure.</p>
<p>Wallulah shrank away from him, and strove to free
herself from his embrace.</p>
<p>&#8220;Let me go,&#8221; she said, in a low, stifled tone.
&#8220;Oh, if I could only die!&#8221;</p>
<p>But he held her close, almost crushing the delicate
form against his breast. She felt his heart beat deeply
and painfully against her own, and in some way it
came to her that every throb was agony, that he was
in the extremity of mental and physical suffering.</p>
<p>&#8220;God help me!&#8221; he said; &#8220;how can I give you up?&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_213' name='page_213'></a>213</span></div>
<p>She realized by woman&#8217;s intuition that his whole
soul was wrung with pain, with an agony darker and
bitterer than her own; and the exceeding greatness
of his suffering gave her strength. A sudden revulsion
of feeling affected her. She looked up at him with
infinite tenderness.</p>
<p>&#8220;I wish I could take all the pain away from you
and bear it myself.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It is God&#8217;s will; we must submit to it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;His will!&#8221; Her voice was full of rebellion. &#8220;Why
does he give us such bitter suffering? Doesn&#8217;t he
care? I thought once that God was good, but it is all
dark now.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Hush, you must not think so. After all, it will be
only a little while till we meet in heaven, and there
no one can take you from me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Heaven is so far off. The present is all that I
can see, and it is as black as death. Death! it would
be sweet to die now with your arms around me; but
to <i>live</i> year after year with him! How can I go to
him, now that I have known you? How can I bear
his presence, his touch?&#8221;</p>
<p>She shuddered there in Cecil&#8217;s arms. All her
being shrunk in repugnance at the thought of Snoqualmie.</p>
<p>&#8220;Thank God for death!&#8221; said Cecil, brokenly.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is so long to wait,&#8221; she murmured, &#8220;and I am
so young and strong.&#8221;</p>
<p>His kisses fell on cheek and brow. She drew down
his head and put her cheek against his and clung to
him as if she would never let him go.</p>
<p>It was a strange scene, the mournful parting of the
lovers in the gloom of the forest and the night. To
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_214' name='page_214'></a>214</span>
the east, through the black net-work of leaves and
branches, a dull red glow marked the crater of Mount
Hood, and its intermittent roar came to them through
the silence. It was a night of mystery and horror,&mdash;a
fitting night for their tragedy of love and woe. The
gloom and terror of their surroundings seemed to
throw a supernatural shadow over their farewell.</p>
<p>&#8220;The burning mountain is angry to-night,&#8221; said
Wallulah, at last. &#8220;Would that it might cover us up
with its ashes and stones, as the Indians say it once
did two lovers back in the old time.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Alas, death never comes to those who wish for it.
When the grace and sweetness are all fled from our
lives, and we would be glad to lie down in the grave
and be at rest, then it is that we must go on living.
Now I must go. The longer we delay our parting the
harder it will be.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not yet, not yet!&#8221; cried Wallulah. &#8220;Think how
long I must be alone,&mdash;always alone until I die.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;God help us!&#8221; said Cecil, setting his teeth. &#8220;I
will dash my mission to the winds and fly with you.
What if God does forsake us, and our souls are lost!
I would rather be in the outer darkness with you than
in heaven without you.&#8221;</p>
<p>His resolution had given way at last. But in such
cases, is it not always the woman that is strongest?</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; she said, &#8220;you told me that your God would
forsake you if you did. It must not be.&#8221;</p>
<p>She withdrew herself from his arms and stood looking
at him. He saw in the moonlight that her pale
tear-stained face had upon it a sorrowful resignation,
a mournful strength, born of very hopelessness.</p>
<p>&#8220;God keep you, Wallulah!&#8221; murmured Cecil, brokenly.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_215' name='page_215'></a>215</span>
&#8220;If I could only feel that he would shelter
and shield you!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That may be as it will,&#8221; replied the sweet, patient
lips. &#8220;I do not know. I shut my eyes to the future.
I only want to take myself away from you, so that your
God will not be angry with you. Up there,&#8221; she said,
pointing, &#8220;I will meet you sometime and be with
you forever. God will not be angry then. Now
farewell.&#8221;</p>
<p>He advanced with outstretched arms. She motioned
him back.</p>
<p>&#8220;It will make it harder,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>For a moment she looked into his eyes, her own
dark, dilated, full of love and sadness; for a moment
all that was within him thrilled to the passionate, yearning
tenderness of her gaze; then she turned and went
away without a word.</p>
<p>He could not bear to see her go, and yet he knew
it must end thus; he dared not follow her or call her
back. But so intense was his desire for her to return,
so vehemently did his life cry out after her, that for an
instant it seemed to him he <i>had</i> called out, &#8220;Come
back! come back!&#8221; The cry rose to his lips; but he
set his teeth and held it back. They <i>must</i> part; was
it not God&#8217;s will? The old pain at his heart returned,
a faintness was on him, and he reeled to the
ground.</p>
<p>Could it be that her spirit felt that unuttered cry,
and that it brought her back? Be this as it may,
while he was recovering from his deadly swoon he
dimly felt her presence beside him, and the soft cool
touch of her fingers on his brow. Then&mdash;or did he
imagine it?&mdash;her lips, cold as those of the dead,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_216' name='page_216'></a>216</span>
touched his own. But when consciousness entirely
returned, he was alone in the forest.</p>
<p>Blind, dizzy, staggering with weakness, he found
his way to the camp. Suddenly, as he drew near it
he felt the earth sway and move beneath him like a
living thing. He caught hold of a tree to escape
being thrown to the ground. There came an awful
burst of flame from Mount Hood. Burning cinders and
scoria lit up the eastern horizon like a fountain of fire.
Then down from the great canyon of the Columbia,
from the heart of the Cascade Range, broke a mighty
thundering sound, as if half a mountain had fallen.
Drowning for a moment the roar of the volcano, the
deep echo rolled from crag to crag, from hill to hill.
A wild chorus of outcries rang from the startled camp,&mdash;the
fierce, wild cry of many tribes mad with fear
yet breathing forth tremulous defiance, the cry of human
dread mingling with the last echoes of that
mysterious crash.</p>

<p>While Cecil was on his way that evening to seek
Wallulah, a canoe with but a single occupant
was dropping down the Columbia toward one of the
many <i>mimaluse</i>, or death-islands, that are washed by
its waters.</p>
<p>An Indian is always stealthy, but there was an
almost more than Indian stealthiness about this
canoe-man&#8217;s movements. Noiselessly, as the twilight
deepened into darkness, the canoe glided out of a
secluded cove not far from the camp; noiselessly
the paddle dipped into the water, and the canoe
passed like a shadow into the night.</p>
<p>On the rocky <i>mimaluse</i> island, some distance below
the mouth of the Willamette, the Indian landed
and drew his boat up on the beach. He looked
around for a moment, glanced at the red glow that
lit the far-off crest of Mount Hood, then turned and
went up the pathway to the ancient burial hut.</p>
<p>Who was it that had dared to visit the island of the
dead after dark? The bravest warriors were not capable
of such temerity. Old men told how, away back
in the past, some braves had ventured upon the island
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_218' name='page_218'></a>218</span>
after nightfall, and had paid the awful forfeit. They
were struck by unseen hands. Weapons that had lain
for years beside the decaying corpses of forgotten
warriors wounded them in the dark. Fleeing to their
canoes in swiftest fear, they found the shadowy pursuit
was swifter still, and were overtaken and struck
down, while the whole island rung with mocking
laughter. One only escaped, plunging all torn and
bruised into the river and swimming to the farther
shore. When he looked back, the island was covered
with moving lights, and the shrill echo of fiendish
mirth came to him across the water. His companions
were never seen again. A little while afterward
the dogs barked all night around his lodge, and in the
morning he was found lying dead upon his couch, his
face ghastly and drawn with fear, as if at some frightful
apparition.</p>
<p>&#8220;He disturbed the <i>mimaluse tillicums</i> [dead people],
and they came for him,&#8221; said the old medicine
men, as they looked at him.</p>
<p>Since then, no one had been on the island except
in the daytime. Little bands of mourners had brought
hither the swathed bodies of their dead, laid them in
the burial hut, lifted the wail over them, and left upon
the first approach of evening.</p>
<p>Who, then, was this,&mdash;the first for generations to set
foot on the <i>mimaluse illahee</i> after dark?</p>
<p>It could be but one, the only one among all the
tribes who would have dared to come, and to come
alone,&mdash;Multnomah, the war-chief, who knew not
what it was to fear the living or the dead.</p>
<p>Startled by the outburst of the great smoking mountains,
which always presaged woe to the Willamettes,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_219' name='page_219'></a>219</span>
perplexed by Tohomish&#8217;s mysterious hints of some
impending calamity, weighed down by a dread presentiment,
he came that night on a strange and superstitious
errand.</p>
<p>On the upper part of the island, above reach of
high water, the burial hut loomed dark and still in
the moonlight as the chief approached it.</p>
<p>Some of the Willamettes, like the Chinooks, practised
canoe burial, but the greater part laid their dead
in huts, as did also the Klickitats and the Cascades.</p>
<p>The war-chief entered the hut. The rude boards
that covered the roof were broken and decayed. The
moonlight shone through many openings, lighting
up the interior with a dim and ghostly radiance.
There, swathed in crumbling cerements, ghastly in
shrunken flesh and protruding bone, lay the dead of
the line of Multnomah,&mdash;the chiefs of the blood
royal who had ruled the Willamettes for many generations.
The giant bones of warriors rested beside
the more delicate skeletons of their women, or the
skeletons, slenderer still, of little children of the
ancient race. The warrior&#8217;s bow lay beside him with
rotting string; the child&#8217;s playthings were still clasped
in fleshless fingers; beside the squaw&#8217;s skull the ear-pendants
of <i>hiagua</i> shells lay where they had fallen
from the crumbling flesh years before.</p>
<p>Near the door, and where the slanting moonbeams
fell full upon it, was the last who had been borne to
the death hut, the mother of Wallulah. Six years before
Multnomah had brought her body,&mdash;brought it
alone, with no eye to behold his grief; and since
then no human tread had disturbed the royal burial-place.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_220' name='page_220'></a>220</span></div>
<p>He came now and looked down upon the body.
It had been tightly swathed, fold upon fold, in some
oriental fabric; and the wrappings, stiffened by time
still showed what had once been a rare symmetry of
form. The face was covered with a linen cloth, yellow
now through age and fitting like a mask to the
features. The chief knelt down and drew away the
face-cloth. The countenance, though shrunken, was
almost perfectly preserved. Indeed, so well preserved
were many of the corpses the first white settlers
found on these <i>mimaluse</i> islands as to cause at
one time a belief that the Indians had some secret
process of embalming their dead. There was no such
process, however,&mdash;nothing save the antiseptic properties
of the ocean breeze which daily fanned the
burial islands of the lower Columbia.</p>
<p>Lovely indeed must the mother of Wallulah have
been in her life. Withered as her features were,
there was a delicate beauty in them still,&mdash;in the
graceful brow, the regular profile, the exquisitely chiselled
chin. Around the shoulders and the small
shapely head her hair had grown in rich luxuriant
masses.</p>
<p>The chief gazed long on the shrunken yet beautiful
face. His iron features grew soft, as none but
Wallulah had ever seen them grow. He touched
gently the hair of his dead wife, and put it back from
her brow with a wistful, caressing tenderness. He
had never understood her; she had always been a
mystery to him; the harsh savagery of his nature had
never been able to enter into or comprehend the
refined grace of hers; but he had loved her with all
the fierce, tenacious, secretive power of his being, a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_221' name='page_221'></a>221</span>
power that neither time nor death could change.
Now he spoke to her, his low tones sounding weird
in that house of the dead,&mdash;a strange place for words
of love.</p>
<p>&#8220;My woman,&mdash;mine yet, for death itself cannot
take from Multnomah that which is his own; my
bird that came from the sea and made its nest for a
little while in the heart of Multnomah and then flew
away and left it empty,&mdash;I have been hungry to see
you, to touch your hair and look upon your face
again. Now I am here, and it is sweet to be with
you, but the heart of Multnomah listens to hear you
speak.&#8221;</p>
<p>He still went on stroking her hair softly, reverently.
It seemed the only caress of which he was capable,
but it had in it a stern and mournful tenderness.</p>
<p>&#8220;Speak to me! The dead talk to the <i>tomanowos</i>
men and the dreamers. You are mine; talk to me;
I am in need. The shadow of something terrible to
come is over the Willamette. The smoking mountains
are angry; the dreamers see only bad signs;
there are black things before Multnomah, and he cannot
see what they are. Tell me,&mdash;the dead are wise
and know that which comes,&mdash;what is this unknown
evil which threatens me and mine?&#8221;</p>
<p>He looked down at her with intense craving, intense
desire, as if his imperious will could reanimate
that silent clay and force to the mute lips the words
he so desired. But the still lips moved not, and the
face lay cold under his burning and commanding gaze.
The chief leaned closer over her; he called her name
aloud,&mdash;something that the Willamette Indians rarely
did, for they believed that if the names of the dead
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_222' name='page_222'></a>222</span>
were spoken, even in conversation, it would bring
them back; so they alluded to their lost ones only indirectly,
and always reluctantly and with fear.</p>
<p>&#8220;Come back!&#8221; said he, repeating the name he
had not spoken for six years. &#8220;You are my own, you
are my woman. Hear me, speak to me, you whom
I love; you who, living or dead, are still the wife of
Multnomah.&#8221;</p>
<p>No expression flitted over the changeless calm of
the face beneath him: no sound came back to his
straining ears except the low intermittent roar of the
far-off volcano.</p>
<p>A sorrowful look crossed his face. As has been
said, there was an indefinable something always between
them, which perhaps must ever be between
those of diverse race. It had been the one mystery
that puzzled him while she was living, and it seemed
to glide, viewless yet impenetrable, between them
now. He rose to his feet.</p>
<p>&#8220;It comes between us again,&#8221; he thought, looking
down at her mournfully. &#8220;It pushed me back when
she was living, and made me feel that I stood outside
her heart even while my arms were around her. It
comes between us now and will not let her speak. If
it was only something I could see and grapple with!&#8221;</p>
<p>And the fierce warrior felt his blood kindle within
him, that not only death but something still more
mysterious and incomprehensible should separate him
from the one he loved. He turned sadly away and
passed on to the interior of the hut. As he gazed
on the crumbling relics of humanity around him, the
wonted look of command came back to his brow.
These <i>should</i> obey; by iron strength of will and mystic
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_223' name='page_223'></a>223</span>
charm he would sway them to his bidding. The
withered lips of death, or spirit voices, should tell him
what he wished to know. Abjectly superstitious as
was the idea it involved, there was yet something
grand in his savage despotic grasp after power that,
dominating all he knew of earth, sought to bend to
his will even the spirit-land.</p>
<p>The chief believed that the departed could talk to
him if they would; for did they not talk to the medicine
men and the dreamers? If so, why not to him, the
great chief, the master of all the tribes of the Wauna?</p>
<p>He knelt down, and began to sway his body back
and forth after the manner of the Nootka <i>shamans</i>,
and to chant a long, low, monotonous song, in which
the names of the dead who lay there were repeated
over and over again.</p>
<p>&#8220;Kamyah, Tlesco, Che-aqah, come back! come
back and tell me the secret, the black secret, the
death secret, the woe that is to come. Winelah,
Sic-mish, Tlaquatin, the land is dark with signs
and omens; the hearts of men are heavy with dread;
the dreamers say that the end is come for Multnomah
and his race. Is it true? Come and tell me.
I wait, I listen, I speak your names; come back,
come back!&#8221;</p>
<p>Tohomish himself would not have dared to repeat
those names in the charnel hut, lest those whom he
invoked should spring upon him and tear him to
pieces. No more potent or more perilous charm
was known to the Indians.</p>
<p>Ever as Multnomah chanted, the sullen roar of the
volcano came like an undertone and filled the pauses
of the wild incantation. And as he went on, it
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_224' name='page_224'></a>224</span>
seemed to the chief that the air grew thick with
ghostly presences. There was a sense of breathing
life all around him. He felt that others, many others,
were with him; yet he saw nothing. When he paused
for some voice, some whisper of reply, this sense of
hyper-physical perception became so acute that he
could almost <i>see</i>, almost <i>hear</i>, in the thick blackness
and the silence; yet no answer came.</p>
<p>Again he resumed his mystic incantation, putting
all the force of his nature into the effort, until it
seemed that even those shadowy things of the night
must yield to his blended entreaty and command.
But there came no response. Thick and thronging
the viewless presences seemed to gather, to look, and
to listen; but no reply came to his ears, and no
sight met his eyes save the swathed corpses and the
white-gleaming bones on which the shifting moonbeams
fell.</p>
<p>Multnomah rose to his feet, baffled, thwarted, all
his soul glowing with anger that he should be so
scorned.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why is this?&#8221; said his stern voice in the silence.
&#8220;You come, but you give no reply; you look, you
listen, but you make no sound. Answer me, you who
know the future; tell me this secret!&#8221;</p>
<p>Still no response. Yet the air seemed full of dense,
magnetic life, of muffled heart-beats, of voiceless, unresponsive,
uncommunicative forms that he could almost
touch.</p>
<p>For perhaps the first time in his life the war-chief
found himself set at naught. His form grew erect; his
eyes gleamed with the terrible wrath which the tribes
dreaded as they dreaded the wrath of the Great Spirit.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you mock Multnomah? Am I not war-chief
of the Willamettes? Though you dwell in shadow
and your bodies are dust, you are Willamettes, and I
am still your chief. Give up your secret! If the
Great Spirit has sealed your lips so that you cannot
speak, give me a sign that will tell me. Answer by
word or sign; I say it,&mdash;I, Multnomah, your chief and
master.&#8221;</p>
<p>Silence again. The roar of the volcano had ceased;
and an ominous stillness brooded over Nature, as if all
things held their breath, anticipating some mighty
and imminent catastrophe. Multnomah&#8217;s hands were
clinched, and his strong face had on it now a fierceness
of command that no eye had ever seen before.
His indomitable will reached out to lay hold of those
unseen presences and compel them to reply.</p>
<p>A moment of strained, commanding expectation:
then the answer came; the sign was given. The earth
shook beneath him till he staggered, almost fell; the
hut creaked and swayed like a storm-driven wreck; and
through the crevices on the side toward Mount Hood
came a blinding burst of flame. Down from the great
gap in the Cascade Range through which flows the
Columbia rolled the far-off thundering crash which
had so startled Cecil and appalled the tribes. Then,
tenfold louder than before, came again the roar of the
volcano.</p>
<p>Too well Multnomah knew what had gone down in
that crash; too well did he read the sign that had
been given. For a moment it seemed as if all the
strength of his heart had broken with that which had
fallen; then the proud dignity of his character reasserted
itself, even in the face of doom.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_226' name='page_226'></a>226</span></div>
<p>&#8220;It has come at last, as the wise men of old said it
would. The end is at hand; the Willamettes pass like
a shadow from the earth. The Great Spirit has forsaken
us, our <i>tomanowos</i> has failed us. But my own
heart fails me not, and my own arm is strong. Like a
war-chief will I meet that which is to come. Multnomah
falls, but he falls as the Bridge has fallen, with a
crash that will shake the earth, with a ruin that shall
crush all beneath him even as he goes down.&#8221;</p>
<p>Turning away, his eyes fell on the body of his wife
as he passed toward the door. Aroused and desperate
as he was, he stopped an instant and looked down
at her with a long, lingering look, a look that seemed
to say, &#8220;I shall meet you ere many suns. Death and
ruin but give you back to me the sooner. There
will be nothing between us then; I shall understand
you at last.&#8221;</p>
<p>Then he drew his robe close around him, and went
out into the night.</p>

<p>The night came to an end at last,&mdash;a night not
soon forgotten by the Oregon Indians, and
destined to be remembered in tale and <i>tomanowos</i>
lore long after that generation had passed away.
The sky was thick with clouds; the atmosphere was
heavy with smoke, which, dense and low-hanging in
the still weather, shut out the entire horizon. The
volcano was invisible in the smoky air, but its low
mutterings came to them from time to time.</p>
<p>The chiefs met early in the grove of council.
Multnomah&#8217;s countenance told nothing of the night
before, but almost all the rest showed something yet
of superstitious fear. Mishlah&#8217;s face was haggard,
his air startled and uneasy, like that of some forest
animal that had been terribly frightened; and even
Snoqualmie looked worn. But the greatest change of
all was in Tohomish. His face was as ghastly as that
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_228' name='page_228'></a>228</span>
of a corpse, and he came into the council walking in
a dull lifeless way, as if hardly aware of what he was
doing. Those nearest to him shrank away, whispering
to one another that the seer looked like a dead
man.</p>
<p>Cecil came last. The severe mental conflict of the
past night had told almost fatally on a frame already
worn out by years of toil and sickness. His cheek
was pale, his eye hollow, his step slow and faltering
like one whose flame of life is burning very low. The
pain at his heart, always worse in times of exhaustion,
was sharp and piercing.</p>
<p>He looked agitated and restless; he had tried
hard to give Wallulah into the hands of God and feel
that she was safe, but he could not. For himself he
had no thought; but his whole soul was wrung with
pain for her. By virtue of his own keen sympathies,
he anticipated and felt all that the years had in store
for her,&mdash;the loneliness, the heartache, the trying to
care for one she loathed; until he shrank from her
desolate and hopeless future as if it had been his
own. All his soul went out to her in yearning tenderness,
in passionate desire to shield her and to take
away her burden.</p>
<p>But his resolution never wavered. Below the ebb
and flow of feeling, the decision to make their separation
final was as unchanging as granite. He could
not bear to look upon her face again; he could not
bear to see her wedded to Snoqualmie. He intended
to make one last appeal to the Indians this morning
to accept the gospel of peace; then he would leave
the council before Wallulah was brought to it. So
he sat there now, waiting for the &#8220;talk&#8221; to begin.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_229' name='page_229'></a>229</span></div>
<p>The bands gathered around the grove were smaller
than usual. Many had fled from the valley at dawn
to escape from the dreaded vicinity of the smoking
mountains; many hundreds remained, but they were
awed and frightened. No war could have appalled
them as they were appalled by the shaking of the
solid earth under their feet. All the abject, superstition
of their natures was roused. They looked like
men who felt themselves caught in the grasp of some
supernatural power.</p>
<p>Multnomah opened the council by saying that two
runners had arrived with news that morning; the one
from the sea-coast, the other from up the Columbia.
They would come before the council and tell the
news they had brought.</p>
<p>The runner from the upper Columbia spoke first.
He had come thirty miles since dawn. He seemed
unnerved and fearful, like one about to announce
some unheard-of calamity. The most stoical bent
forward eagerly to hear.</p>
<p>&#8220;<i>The Great Spirit has shaken the earth, and the
Bridge of the Gods has fallen!</i>&#8221;</p>
<p>There was the silence of amazement; then through
the tribes passed in many tongues the wild and wondering
murmur, &#8220;The Bridge of the Gods has fallen!
The Bridge of the Gods has fallen!&#8221; With it, too,
went the recollection of the ancient prophecy that
when the Bridge fell the power of the Willamettes
would also fall. Now the Bridge was broken, and
the dominion of the Willamettes was broken forever
with it. At another time the slumbering jealousy of
the tribes would have burst forth in terrific vengeance
on the doomed race. But they were dejected and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_230' name='page_230'></a>230</span>
afraid. In the fall of the Bridge they saw the hand
of the Great Spirit, a visitation of God. And so
Willamette and tributary alike heard the news with
fear and apprehension. Only Multnomah, who knew
the message before it was spoken, listened with his
wonted composure.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is well,&#8221; he said, with more than Indian duplicity;
&#8220;the daughter of Multnomah is to become the
wife of Snoqualmie the Cayuse, and the new line
that commences with their children will give new
chiefs to head the confederacy of the Wauna. The
old gives way to the new. That is the sign that the
Great Spirit gives in the fall of the Bridge. Think
you it means that the war-strength is gone from us,
that we shall no longer prevail in battle? No, no!
who thinks it?&#8221;</p>
<p>The proud old sachem rose to his feet; his giant
form towered over the multitude, and every eye fell
before the haughty and scornful glance that swept
council and audience like a challenge to battle.</p>
<p>&#8220;Is there a chief here that thinks it? Let him
step out, let him grapple with Multnomah in the
death-grapple, and see. Is there a tribe that thinks
it? We reach out our arms to them; we are ready.
Let them meet us in battle now, to-day, and know if
our hearts have become the hearts of women. Will
you come? We will give you dark and bloody proof
that our tomahawks are still sharp and our arms are
strong.&#8221;</p>
<p>He stood with outstretched arms, from which the
robe of fur had fallen back. A thrill of dread went
through the assembly at the grim defiance; then
Snoqualmie spoke.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_231' name='page_231'></a>231</span></div>
<p>&#8220;The heart of all the tribes is as the heart of
Multnomah. Let there be peace.&#8221;</p>
<p>The chief resumed his seat. His force of will had
wrung one last victory from fate itself. Instantly, and
with consummate address, Multnomah preoccupied the
attention of the council before anything could be said
or done to impair the effect of his challenge. He
bade the other runner, the one from the sea-coast,
deliver his message.</p>
<p>It was, in effect, this:&mdash;</p>
<p>A large canoe, with great white wings like a bird,
had come gliding over the waters to the coast near the
mouth of the Wauna. Whence it came no one could
tell; but its crew were pale of skin like the great white
<i>shaman</i> there in the council, and seemed of his race.
Some of them came ashore in a small canoe to trade
with the Indians, but trouble rose between them and
there was a battle. The strangers slew many Indians
with their magic, darting fire at them from long black
tubes. Then they escaped to the great canoe, which
spread its wings and passed away from sight into the
sea. Many of the Indians were killed, but none of the
pale-faced intruders. Now the band who had suffered
demanded that the white man of whom they had heard&mdash;the
white chief at the council&mdash;be put to death
to pay the blood-debt.</p>
<p>All eyes turned on Cecil, and he felt that his hour
was come. Weak, exhausted in body and mind, wearied
almost to death, a sudden and awful peril was on
him. For a moment his heart sank, his brain grew
dizzy. How <i>could</i> he meet this emergency? All his
soul went out to God with a dumb prayer for help,
with an overwhelming sense of weakness. Then he
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_232' name='page_232'></a>232</span>
heard Multnomah speaking to him in cold, hard
tones.</p>
<p>&#8220;The white man has heard the words of the runner.
What has he to say why his life should not pay the
blood-debt?&#8221;</p>
<p>Cecil rose to his feet. With one last effort he put
Wallulah, himself, his mission, into the hands of God;
with one last effort he forced himself to speak.</p>
<p>Men of nervous temperament, like Cecil, can bring
out of an exhausted body an energy, an outburst of
final and intense effort, of which those of stronger
physique do not seem capable. But it drains the
remaining vital forces, and the reaction is terrible.
Was it this flaming-up of the almost burned-out embers
of life that animated Cecil now? Or was it the
Divine Strength coming to him in answer to prayer?
Be this as it may, when he opened his lips to speak,
all the power of his consecration came back; physical
weakness and mental anxiety left him; he felt that
Wallulah was safe in the arms of the Infinite Compassion;
he felt his love for the Indians, his deep yearning
to help them, to bring them to God, rekindling
within him; and never had he been more grandly the
Apostle to the Indians than now.</p>
<p>In passionate tenderness, in burning appeal, in living
force and power of delivery, it was the supreme
effort of his life. He did not plead for himself; he ignored,
put aside, forgot his own personal danger; but
he set before his hearers the wickedness of their own
system of retaliation and revenge; he showed them
how it overshadowed their lives and lay like a deadening
weight on their better natures. The horror, the
cruelty, the brute animalism of the blood-thirst, the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_233' name='page_233'></a>233</span>
war-lust, was set over against the love and forgiveness
to which the Great Spirit called them.</p>
<p>The hearts of the Indians were shaken within
them. The barbarism which was the outcome of
centuries of strife and revenge, the dark and cumulative
growth of ages, was stirred to its core by
the strong and tender eloquence of this one man.
As he spoke, there came to all those swarthy listeners,
in dim beauty, a glimpse of a better life;
there came to them a moment&#8217;s fleeting revelation
of something above their own vindictiveness and
ferocity. That vague longing, that indefinable wistfulness
which he had so often seen on the faces of
his savage audiences was on nearly every face when
he closed.</p>
<p>As he took his seat, the tide of inspiration went
from him, and a deadly faintness came over him. It
seemed as if in that awful reaction the last spark of
vitality was dying out; but somehow, through it all,
he felt at peace with God and man. A great quiet
was upon him; he was anxious for nothing, he cared
for nothing, he simply rested as on the living presence
of the Father.</p>
<p>Upon the sweet and lingering spell of his closing
words came Multnomah&#8217;s tones in stern contrast.</p>
<p>&#8220;What is the word of the council? Shall the white
man live or die?&#8221;</p>
<p>Snoqualmie was on his feet in an instant.</p>
<p>&#8220;Blood for blood. Let the white man die at the
torture-stake.&#8221;</p>
<p>One by one the chiefs gave their voice for death.
Shaken for but a moment, the ancient inherited barbarism
which was their very life reasserted itself, and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_234' name='page_234'></a>234</span>
they could decide no other way. One, two, three of
the sachems gave no answer, but sat in silence. They
were men whose hearts had been touched before by
Cecil, and who were already desiring the better life
They could not condemn their teacher.</p>
<p>At length it came to Tohomish. He arose. His
face, always repulsive, was pallid now in the extreme.
The swathed corpses on <i>mimaluse</i> island looked not
more sunken and ghastly.</p>
<p>He essayed to speak; thrice the words faltered on
his lips; and when at last he spoke, it was in a weary,
lifeless way. His tones startled the audience like an
electric shock. The marvellous power and sweetness
were gone from his voice; its accents were discordant,
uncertain. Could the death&#8217;s head before them be
that of Tohomish? Could those harsh and broken
tones be those of the Pine Voice? He seemed like
a man whose animal life still survived, but whose soul
was dead.</p>
<p>What he said at first had no relation to the matter
before the council. Every Indian had his <i>tomanowos</i>
appointed him by the Great Spirit from his birth,
and that <i>tomanowos</i> was the strength of his life. Its
influence grew with his growth; the roots of his being
were fed in it; it imparted its characteristics to him.
But the name and nature of his <i>tomanowos</i> was the
one secret that must go with him to the grave. If it
was told, the charm was lost and the <i>tomanowos</i> deserted
him.</p>
<p>Tohomish&#8217;s <i>tomanowos</i> was the Bridge and the foreknowledge
of its fall: a black secret that had darkened
his whole life, and imparted the strange and mournful
mystery to his eloquence. Now that the Bridge was
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_235' name='page_235'></a>235</span>
fallen, the strength was gone from Tohomish&#8217;s heart,
the music from his words.</p>
<p>&#8220;Tohomish has no voice now,&#8221; he continued; &#8220;he
is as one dead. He desires to say only this, then
his words shall be heard no more among men. The
fall of the Bridge is a sign that not only the Willamettes
but all the tribes of the Wauna shall fall and
pass away. Another people shall take our place,
another race shall reign in our stead, and the Indian
shall be forgotten, or remembered only as a dim
memory of the past.</p>
<p>&#8220;And who are they who bring us our doom? Look
on the face of the white wanderer there; listen to the
story of your brethren slain at the sea-coast by the
white men in the canoe, and you will know. They
come; they that are stronger, and push us out into the
dark. The white wanderer talks of peace; but the
Great Spirit has put death between the Indian and
the white man, and where he has put death there can
be no peace.</p>
<p>&#8220;Slay the white man as the white race will slay
your children in the time that is to come. Peace?
love? There can be only war and hate. Striking back
blow for blow like a wounded rattlesnake, shall the red
man pass; and when the bones of the last Indian of
the Wauna lie bleaching on the prairie far from the
<i>mimaluse</i> island of his fathers, then there will be peace.</p>
<p>&#8220;Tohomish has spoken; his words are ended, and
ended forever.&#8221;</p>
<p>The harsh, disjointed tones ceased. All eyes fell
again on Cecil, the representative of the race by which
the Willamettes were doomed. The wrath of all those
hundreds, the vengeance of all those gathered tribes
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_236' name='page_236'></a>236</span>
of the Wauna, the hatred of the whole people he had
come to save, seemed to rise up and fall upon him
the frail invalid with the sharp pain throbbing at his
heart.</p>
<p>But that strange peace was on him still, and his
eyes, dilated and brilliant in the extremity of physical
pain, met those lowering brows with a look of exceeding
pity.</p>
<p>Multnomah rose to pronounce sentence. For him
there could be but one decision, and he gave it,&mdash;the
clinched hand, the downward gesture, that said,
&#8220;There is death between us. We will slay as we
shall be slain.&#8221;</p>
<p>Cecil was on his feet, though it seemed as if he
must fall within the moment. He fought down the pain
that pierced his heart like a knife; he gathered
the last resources of an exhausted frame for one more
effort. The executioners sprang forward with the
covering for his eyes that was to shut out the light
forever. His glance, his gesture held them back;
they paused irresolutely, even in the presence of Multnomah;
weak as Cecil was, he was the great white
<i>tomanowos</i> still, and they dared not touch him.
There was a pause, an intense silence.</p>
<p>&#8220;I gave up all to come and tell you of God, and
you have condemned me to die at the torture-stake,&#8221;
said the soft, low voice, sending through their stern
hearts its thrill and pathos for the last time. &#8220;But
you shall not bring this blood-stain upon your souls.
The hand of the Great Spirit is on me; he takes me
to himself. Remember&mdash;what I have said. The
Great Spirit loves you. Pray&mdash;forgive&mdash;be at
peace. Remember&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_237' name='page_237'></a>237</span></div>
<p>The quiver of agonizing pain disturbed the gentleness
of his look; he reeled, and sank to the ground.
For a moment the slight form shuddered convulsively
and the hands were clinched; then the struggle ceased
and a wonderful brightness shone upon his face. His
lips murmured something in his own tongue, something
into which came the name of Wallulah and the
name of God. Then his eyes grew dim and he lay
very still. Only the expression of perfect peace still
rested on the face. Sachems and warriors gazed in
awe upon the beauty, grand in death, of the one whom
the Great Spirit had taken from them. Perhaps the
iron heart of the war-chief was the only one that did
not feel remorse and self-reproach.</p>
<p>Ere the silence was broken, an old Indian woman
came forward from the crowd into the circle of chiefs.
She looked neither to the right nor to the left, but advanced
among the warrior-sachems, into whose presence
no woman had dared intrude herself, and bent
over the dead. She lifted the wasted body in her
arms and bore it away, with shut lips and downcast
eyes, asking no permission, saying no word.
The charm that had been around the white <i>shaman</i> in
life seemed to invest her with its power; for grim
chieftains made way, the crowd opened to let her
pass, and even Multnomah looked on in silence.</p>
<p>That afternoon, a little band of Indians were assembled
in Cecil&#8217;s lodge. Some of them were already
converts; some were only awakened and impressed;
but all were men who loved him.</p>
<p>They were gathered, men of huge frame, around a
dead body that lay upon a cougar skin. Their faces
were sad, their manner was solemn. In the corner
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_238' name='page_238'></a>238</span>
sat an aged squaw, her face resting in her hands, her
long gray hair falling dishevelled about her shoulders.
In that heart-broken attitude she had sat ever since
bringing Cecil to the hut. She did not weep or sob
but sat motionless, in stoical, dumb despair.</p>
<p>Around the dead the Indians stood or sat in
silence, each waiting for the other to say what was in
the hearts of all. At length the Shoshone renegade
who had so loved Cecil, spoke.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our white brother is gone from us, but the Great
Spirit lives and dies not. Let us turn from blood
and sin and walk in the way our brother showed us.
He said, &#8216;Remember;&#8217; and shall we forget? I choose
now, while he can hear me, before he is laid in the
cold ground. I put away from me the old heart
of hate and revenge. I ask the Great Spirit to give
me the new heart of love and peace. I have chosen.&#8221;</p>
<p>One by one each told his resolve, the swarthy faces
lighting up, the stern lips saying unwonted words of
love. Dim and misty, the dawn had come to them;
reaching out in the dark, they had got hold of the
hand of God and felt that he was a Father. One
would have said that their dead teacher lying there
heard their vows, so calm and full of peace was the
white still face.</p>
<p>That night the first beams of the rising moon fell
on a new-made grave under the cottonwoods, not
far from the bank of the river. Beneath it, silent in
the last sleep, lay the student whose graceful presence
had been the pride of far-off Magdalen, the pastor
whose memory still lingered in New England, the
evangelist whose burning words had thrilled the tribes
of the wilderness like the words of some prophet of old.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_239' name='page_239'></a>239</span></div>
<p>Beside the grave crouched the old Indian woman,
alone and forsaken in her despair,&mdash;the one mourner
out of all for whom his life had been given.</p>
<p>No, not the only one; for a tall warrior enters the
grove; the Shoshone renegade bends over her and
touches her gently on the shoulder.</p>
<p>&#8220;Come,&#8221; he says kindly, &#8220;our horses are saddled;
we take the trail up the Wauna to-night, I and my
friends. We will fly from this fated valley ere the
wrath of the Great Spirit falls upon it. Beyond the
mountains I will seek a new home with the Spokanes
or the Okanogans. Come; my home shall be your
home, because you cared for him that is gone.&#8221;</p>
<p>She shook her head and pointed to the grave.</p>
<p>&#8220;My heart is there; my life is buried with him. I
cannot go.&#8221;</p>
<p>Again he urged her.</p>
<p>&#8220;No, no,&#8221; she replied, with Indian stubbornness;
&#8220;I cannot leave him. Was I not like his mother?
How can I go and leave him for others? The roots
of the old tree grow not in new soil. If it is pulled
up it dies.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Come with me,&#8221; said the savage, with a gentleness
born of his new faith. &#8220;Be <i>my</i> mother. We will talk
of him; you shall tell me of him and his God. Come,
the horses wait.&#8221;</p>
<p>Again she shook her head; then fell forward on the
grave, her arms thrown out, as if to clasp it in her
embrace. He tried to lift her; her head fell back,
and she lay relaxed and motionless in his arms.</p>
<p>Another grave was made by Cecil&#8217;s; and the little
band rode through the mountain pass that night,
toward the country of the Okanogans, without her.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_240' name='page_240'></a>240</span></div>
<p>And that same night, an English exploring vessel
far out at sea sailed southward, leaving behind the
unknown shores of Oregon,&mdash;her crew never dreaming
how near they had been to finding the lost
wanderer, Cecil Grey.</p>

<p>After Cecil had been borne from the council-grove,
the Indians, rousing themselves from the
spell of the strange scene they had just witnessed,
looked around for Tohomish the seer. He was gone.
No one could remember seeing him go, yet he was
missing from his accustomed place, and never was he
seen or heard of more. Upon his fate, lost in the
common ruin that engulfed his race, the legend casts
no ray of light. It is certain that the fall of the
Bridge, with which his life was interwoven, had a
disastrous effect upon him, and as he said, that the
strength of his life was broken. It is probable that
the orator-seer, feeling within himself that his power
was gone, crept away into the forest to die. Perhaps,
had they searched for him, they would have found
him lying lifeless upon the leaves in some dense
thicket or at the foot of some lonely crag.</p>
<p>Whatever his fate, the Indians never looked upon
his face again.</p>
<p>Multnomah made no comment on the death of
Cecil, or on the prophecy of Tohomish, so much at
variance with his own interpretation of the fall of the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_242' name='page_242'></a>242</span>
Bridge. Whatever he had to say was evidently held
in reserve for the closing talk with which he would
soon dismiss the council.</p>
<p>&#8220;You shall see Multnomah&#8217;s daughter given to
Snoqualmie, and then Multnomah will open his hand
and make you rich.&#8221;</p>
<p>So said the war-chief; and a runner was dispatched
with a summons to Wallulah. In a little while a band
of Indian girls was seen approaching the grove. Surrounded
by the maidens, as if they were a guard of
honor, came Wallulah, all unconscious of the tragedy
that had just been enacted.</p>
<p>Among the chiefs they passed, and stopped before
Multnomah. As they paused, Wallulah looked around
for Cecil in one quick glance; then, not seeing him,
she cast down her eyes despondingly. Multnomah
rose and beckoned Snoqualmie to him. He came
forward and stood beside the war-chief. The Indian
girls stepped back a little, in involuntary awe of the
two great sachems, and left Wallulah standing alone
before them.</p>
<p>Her face wore a patient look, as of one who is very
worn and weary, tired of the burdens of life, yet going
forward without hope, without thought even, to other
and still heavier burdens. She was clad in a soft
oriental fabric; her hair fell in luxuriant tresses upon
her shoulders; her flute hung at her belt by a slender
chain of gold.</p>
<p>There was something unspeakably sad and heart-broken
in her appearance, as she stood there, a
listless, dejected figure, before those two grim warriors,
awaiting her doom.</p>
<p>Multnomah took her hand; the fingers of the other
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_243' name='page_243'></a>243</span>
were clasped around her beloved flute, pressing it
closely, as if seeking help from its mute companionship.
The chief gave her hand into Snoqualmie&#8217;s; a
shudder passed through her as she felt his touch, and
she trembled from head to foot; then she controlled
herself by a strong effort. Snoqualmie&#8217;s fierce black
eyes searched her face, as if looking through and
through her, and she flushed faintly under their
penetrating gaze.</p>
<p>&#8220;She is yours,&#8221; said the war-chief. &#8220;Be kind to
her, for though she is your wife she is the daughter
of Multnomah.&#8221; So much did the Indian say for
love of his child, wondering at her strange, sad look,
and feeling vaguely that she was unhappy. She tried
to withdraw her fingers from Snoqualmie&#8217;s clasp the
moment her father was done speaking. He held
them tightly, however, and bending over her, spoke
in a low tone.</p>
<p>&#8220;My band starts for home at mid-day. Be ready
to go when I send for you.&#8221;</p>
<p>She looked up with startled, piteous eyes.</p>
<p>&#8220;To-day?&#8221; she asked in a choked voice.</p>
<p>&#8220;To-day,&#8221; came the abrupt reply; too low for the
others to hear, yet harsh enough to sting her through
and through. &#8220;Do you think Snoqualmie goes back
to his <i>illahee</i> and leaves his woman behind?&#8221;</p>
<p>Her spirit kindled in resentment. Never had the
chief&#8217;s daughter been spoken to so harshly; then all
at once it came to her that he <i>knew</i>,&mdash;that he must
have followed Cecil and witnessed one of their last
interviews. Jealous, revengeful, the Indian was her
master now. She grew pale to the lips. He released
her hand, and she shrank away from him, and left the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_244' name='page_244'></a>244</span>
council with her maidens. No one had heard the
few half-whispered words that passed between them
but those who stood nearest noticed the deadly pallor
that came over her face while Snoqualmie was speaking.
Multnomah saw it, and Snoqualmie caught from
him a glance that chilled even his haughty nature&mdash;a
glance that said, &#8220;Beware; she is the war-chief&#8217;s
daughter.&#8221;</p>
<p>But even if he had known all, Multnomah would
have sacrificed her. His plans must be carried out
even though her heart be crushed.</p>
<p>Now followed the <i>potlatch</i>,&mdash;the giving of gifts.
At a signal from the war-chief, his slaves appeared,
laden with presents. Large heaps of rich furs and
skins were laid on the ground near the chiefs. The
finest of bows and arrows, with gaily decorated quivers
and store of bow-strings, were brought. Untold treasure
of <i>hiagua</i> shells, money as well as ornament to
the Oregon Indians, was poured out upon the ground,
and lay glistening in the sun in bright-colored masses.
To the Indians they represented vast and splendid
wealth. Multnomah was the richest of all the Indians
of the Wauna; and the gifts displayed were the
spoil of many wars, treasures garnered during forty
years of sovereignty.</p>
<p>And now they were all given away. The chief
kept back nothing, except some cases of oriental
fabrics that had been saved from the wreck when
Wallulah&#8217;s mother was cast upon the shore. Well
would it have been for him and his race had they
been given too; for, little as they dreamed it, the
fate of the Willamettes lay sealed up in those unopened
cases of silk and damask.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_245' name='page_245'></a>245</span></div>
<p>Again and again the slaves of Multnomah added
their burdens to the heaps, and went back for more,
till a murmur of wonder rose among the crowd. His
riches seemed exhaustless. At length, however, all was
brought. The chief stood up, and, opening his hands
to them in the Indian gesture for giving, said,&mdash;</p>
<p>&#8220;There is all that was Multnomah&#8217;s; it is yours;
your hands are full now and mine are empty.&#8221;</p>
<p>The chiefs and warriors rose up gravely and went
among the heaps of treasure; each selecting from
furs and skins, arms and <i>hiagua</i> shells, that which he
desired. There was no unseemly haste or snatching;
a quiet decorum prevailed among them. The women
and children were excluded from sharing in these
gifts, but provisions&mdash;dried meats and berries, and
bread of <i>camas</i> or Wappatto root&mdash;were thrown
among them on the outskirts of the crowd where
they were gathered. And unlike the men, they
scrambled for it like hungry animals; save where here
and there the wife or daughter of a chief stood looking
disdainfully on the food and those who snatched at it.</p>
<p>Such giving of gifts, or <i>potlatches</i>, are still known
among the Indians. On Puget Sound and the Okanogan,
one occasionally hears of some rich Indian
making a great <i>potlatch</i>,&mdash;giving away all his possessions,
and gaining nothing but a reputation for
disdain of wealth, a reputation which only Indian
stoicism would crave. Multnomah&#8217;s object was not
that so much as to make, before the dispersal of the
tribes, a last and most favorable impression.</p>
<p>When the presents were all divided, the chiefs resumed
their places to hear the last speech of Multnomah,&mdash;the
speech that closed the council.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_246' name='page_246'></a>246</span></div>
<p>It was a masterpiece of dignity, subtility, and command.
The prophecy of Tohomish was evaded, the
fall of the Bridge wrested into an omen propitious to
the Willamettes; and at last his hearers found themselves
believing as he wished them to believe, without
knowing how or why, so strongly did the overmastering
personality of Multnomah penetrate and sway
their lesser natures. He particularly dwelt on the
idea that they were all knit together now and were as
one race. Yet through the smooth words ran a latent
threat, a covert warning of the result of any revolt
against his authority based on what plotting dreamers
might say of the fall of the Bridge,&mdash;a half-expressed
menace, like the gleam of a sword half drawn from
the scabbard. And he closed by announcing that
ere another spring the young men of all the tribes
would go on the war-path against the Shoshones and
come back loaded with spoil. And so, kindling the
hatred of the chiefs against the common enemy,
Multnomah closed the great council.</p>
<p>In a little while the camp was all astir with preparation
for departure. Lodges were being taken down,
the mats that covered them rolled up and packed
on the backs of horses; all was bustle and tumult.
Troop after troop crossed the river and took the trail
toward the upper Columbia.</p>
<p>But when the bands passed from under the personal
influence of Multnomah, they talked of the ominous
things that had just happened; they said to each
other that the Great Spirit had forsaken the Willamettes,
and that when they came into the valley
again it would be to plunder and to slay. Multnomah
had stayed the tide but for a moment. The fall of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_247' name='page_247'></a>247</span>
the ancient <i>tomanowos</i> of the Willamettes had a tremendous
significance to the restless tributaries, and
already the confederacy of the Wauna was crumbling
like a rope of sand. Those tribes would meet no
more in peace on the island of council.</p>

<p>The main body of Snoqualmie&#8217;s followers crossed
to the north bank of the Columbia and took
the trail leading up the river toward the inland prairies.
But Snoqualmie and Wallulah went by canoe as
far as the now ruined Bridge of the Gods. There
were three canoes in their train. Snoqualmie and
Wallulah occupied the first; the other two were laden
with the rich things that had once made her lodge so
beautiful. It stood all bare and deserted now, the
splendor stripped from its rough bark walls even as
love and hope had been reft from the heart of its
mistress. Tapestries, divans, carpets, mirrors, were
heaped in the canoes like spoil torn from the enemy.</p>
<p>The farewell between Wallulah and her father had
been sorrowful. It was remembered afterward, by
those who were witnesses of it, that the war-chief had
shown a tenderness unusual with him, that he had
seemed reluctant to part with his daughter, and that
she had clung to him, pale and tearful, as if he were
her last hope on earth.</p>
<p>When Snoqualmie took her hand to lead her away,
she shuddered, withdrew her fingers from his clasp,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_249' name='page_249'></a>249</span>
and walked alone to the canoe. He entered after
her: the canoe-men dipped their paddles into the
water, and the vessel glided away from the island.</p>
<p>She sat reclining on a heap of furs, her elbows
sunk in them, her cheek resting on her hand, her
eyes turned back toward her island home. Between
it and her the expanse of waters grew ever broader,
and the trail the canoe left behind it sparkled in a
thousand silvery ripples. The island, with its green
prairies and its stately woods, receded fast. She felt
as she looked back as if everything was slipping away
from her. Lonely as her life had been before Cecil
came into it, she had still had her music and her
beautiful rooms in the bark lodge; and they seemed
infinitely sweet and precious now as she recalled them.
Oh, if she could only have them back again! And
those interviews with Cecil. How love and grief
shook the little figure as she thought! How loathingly
she shrunk from the presence of the barbarian
at her side! And all the time the island receded
farther and farther in the distance, and the canoe
glided forward like a merciless fate bearing her on
and on toward the savagery of the inland desert.</p>
<p>Snoqualmie sat watching her with glittering, triumphant
eyes. To him she was no more than some
lovely animal of which he had become the owner;
and ownership of course brought with it the right to
tantalize and to torture. A malicious smile crossed
his lips as he saw how sorrowfully her gaze rested on
her old home.</p>
<p>&#8220;Look forward,&#8221; he said, &#8220;not back; look forward
to your life with Snoqualmie and to the lodge that
awaits you in the land of the Cayuses.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_250' name='page_250'></a>250</span></div>
<p>She started, and her face flushed painfully; then
without looking at him she replied,&mdash;</p>
<p>&#8220;Wallulah loves her home, and leaving it saddens
her.&#8221;</p>
<p>A sparkle of vindictive delight came into his eyes.</p>
<p>&#8220;Do the women of the Willamette feel sad when
they go to live with their husbands? It is not so
with the Cayuse women. They are glad; <i>they</i> care for
the one they belong to. They love to sit in the sun
at the door of the wigwam and say to the other
women, &#8216;My man is brave; he leads the war party;
he has many scalps at his belt. Who is brave like
my man?&#8217;&#8221;</p>
<p>Wallulah shuddered. He saw it, and the sparkle of
malice in his eyes flashed into sudden anger.</p>
<p>&#8220;Does the young squaw tremble at these things?
Then she must get used to them. She must learn to
bring wood and water for Snoqualmie&#8217;s lodge, too.
She must learn to wait on him as an Indian&#8217;s wife
ought. The old wrinkled squaws, who are good for
nothing but to be beasts of burden, shall teach her.&#8221;</p>
<p>There came before her a picture of the ancient
withered hags, the burden-bearers, the human vampires
of the Indian camps, the vile in word and
deed, the first to cry for the blood of captives, the
most eager to give taunts and blows to the helpless;
were they to be her associates, her teachers? Involuntarily
she lifted her hand, as if to push from her a
future so dreadful.</p>
<p>&#8220;Wallulah will bring the wood and the water.
Wallulah will work. The old women need not teach
her.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That is well. But one thing more you must
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_251' name='page_251'></a>251</span>
learn; and that is to hold up your head and not look
like a drooping captive. Smile, laugh, be gay. Snoqualmie
will have no clouded face, no bent head in
his lodge.&#8221;</p>
<p>She looked at him imploringly. The huge form,
the swarthy face, seemed to dominate her, to crush
her down with their barbarian strength and ferocity.
She dropped her eyes again, and lay there on the
furs like some frightened bird shrinking from the
glance of a hawk.</p>
<p>&#8220;I will work; I will bear burdens,&#8221; she repeated,
in a trembling tone. &#8220;But I cannot smile and laugh
when my heart is heavy.&#8221;</p>
<p>He watched her with a half angry, half malicious
regard, a regard that seemed ruthlessly probing into
every secret of her nature.</p>
<p>She knew somehow that he was aware of her love
for Cecil, and she dreaded lest he should taunt her
with it. Anything but that. He knew it, and held
it back as his last and most cruel blow. Over his
bronzed face flitted no expression of pity. She was
to him like some delicate wounded creature of the
forest, that it was a pleasure to torture. So he had
often treated a maimed bird or fawn,&mdash;tantalizing it,
delighted by its fluttering and its pain, till the lust
of torture was gratified and the death-blow was
given.</p>
<p>He sat regarding her with a sneering, malicious
look for a little while; then he said,&mdash;</p>
<p>&#8220;It is hard to smile on Snoqualmie; but the white
man whom you met in the wood, it was not so with
him. It was easy to smile and look glad at him, but
it is hard to do so for Snoqualmie.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_252' name='page_252'></a>252</span></div>
<p>Wallulah shrunk as if he had struck her a blow;
then she looked at him desperately, pleadingly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Do not say such cruel things. I will be a faithful
wife to you. I will never see the white man
again.&#8221;</p>
<p>The sneering malice in his eyes gave way to the
gleam of exultant anger.</p>
<p>&#8220;Faithful! You knew you were to be my woman
when you let him put his arms around you and say
soft things to you. Faithful! You would leave
Snoqualmie for him now, could it be so. But you
say well that you will never see him again.&#8221;</p>
<p>She gazed at him in terror.</p>
<p>&#8220;What do you mean? Has anything happened to
him? Have they harmed him?&#8221;</p>
<p>Over the chief&#8217;s face came the murderous expression
that was there when he slew the Bannock warrior
at the torture stake.</p>
<p>&#8220;Harmed him! Do you think that he could meet
you alone and say sweet things to you and caress
you,&mdash;you who were the same as my squaw,&mdash;and I
not harm him? He is dead; I slew him.&#8221;</p>
<p>False though it was, in so far as Snoqualmie claimed
to have himself slain Cecil, it was thoroughly in keeping
with Indian character. White captives were often
told, &#8220;I killed your brother,&#8221; or, &#8220;This is your husband&#8217;s
scalp,&#8221; when perhaps the person spoken of
was alive and well.</p>
<p>&#8220;Dead!&#8221;</p>
<p>He threw his tomahawk at her feet.</p>
<p>&#8220;His blood is on it. You are Snoqualmie&#8217;s squaw;
wash it off.&#8221;</p>
<p>Dead, dead, her lover was dead! That was all she
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_253' name='page_253'></a>253</span>
could grasp. Snoqualmie&#8217;s insulting command passed
unheeded. She sat looking at the Indian with bright,
dazed eyes that saw nothing. All the world seemed
blotted out.</p>
<p>&#8220;I tell you that he is dead, and I slew him. Are
you asleep that you stare at me so? Awaken and
do as I bid you; wash your lover&#8217;s blood off my
tomahawk.&#8221;</p>
<p>At first she had been stunned by the terrible shock,
and she could realize only that Cecil was dead. Now
it came to her, dimly at first, then like a flash of fire,
that Snoqualmie had slain him. All her spirit leaped
up in uncontrollable hatred. For once, she was the
war-chief&#8217;s daughter. She drew her skirts away from
the tomahawk in unutterable horror; her eyes blazed
into Snoqualmie&#8217;s a defiance and scorn before which
his own sunk for the instant.</p>
<p>&#8220;You killed him! I hate you. I will never be
your wife. You have thrown the tomahawk between
us; it shall be between us forever. Murderer! You
have killed the one I love. Yes, I loved him; and I
hate you and will hate you till I die.&#8221;</p>
<p>The passion in her voice thrilled even the canoe-men,
and their paddle strokes fell confusedly for an
instant, though they did not understand; for both
Wallulah and Snoqualmie had spoken in the royal
tongue of the Willamettes. He sat abashed for an
instant, taken utterly by surprise.</p>
<p>Then the wild impulse of defiance passed, and
the awful sense of bereavement came back like the
falling of darkness over a sinking flame. Cecil was
gone from her, gone for all time. The world seemed
unreal, empty. She sunk among the furs like one
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_254' name='page_254'></a>254</span>
stricken down. Snoqualmie, recovering from his momentary
rebuff, heaped bitter epithets and scornful
words upon her; but she neither saw nor heard,
and lay with wide, bright, staring eyes. Her seeming
indifference maddened him still more, and he
hurled at her the fiercest abuse. She looked at him
vaguely. He saw that she did not even know what
he was saying, and relapsed into sullen silence. She
lay mute and still, with a strained expression of pain
in her eyes. The canoe sped swiftly on.</p>
<p>One desolating thought repeated itself again and
again,&mdash;the thought of hopeless and irreparable loss.
By it past and present were blotted out. By and
by, when she awoke from the stupor of despair and
realized her future, destined to be passed with the
murderer of her lover, what then? But now she was
stunned with the shock of a grief that was mercy
compared with the awakening that must come.</p>
<p>They were in the heart of the Cascade Mountains,
and a low deep roar began to reach their ears, rousing
and startling all but Wallulah. It was the sound of
the cascades, of the new cataract formed by the fall
of the Great Bridge. Rounding a bend in the river
they came in sight of it. The mighty arch, the long
low mountain of stone, had fallen in, damming up the
waters of the Columbia, which were pouring over the
sunken mass in an ever-increasing volume. Above,
the river, raised by the enormous dam, had spread
out like a lake, almost submerging the trees that still
stood along the former bank. Below the new falls
the river was comparatively shallow, its rocky bed
half exposed by the sudden stoppage of the waters.</p>
<p>The Indians gazed with superstitious awe on the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_255' name='page_255'></a>255</span>
vast barrier over which the white and foaming waters
were pouring. The unwonted roar of the falls, a roar
that seemed to increase every moment as the swelling
waters rushed over the rocks; the sight of the
wreck of the mysterious bridge, foreshadowing the
direst calamities,&mdash;all this awed the wild children
of the desert. They approached the falls slowly and
cautiously.</p>
<p>A brief command from Snoqualmie, and they landed
on the northern side of the river, not far from the foot
of the falls. There they must disembark, and the
canoes be carried around the falls on the shoulders
of Indians and launched above.</p>
<p>The roar of the Cascades roused Wallulah from her
stupor. She stepped ashore and looked in dazed
wonder on the strange new world around her. Snoqualmie
told her briefly that she must walk up the
bank to the place where the canoe was to be launched
again above the falls. She listened mutely, and started
to go. But the way was steep and rocky; the bank
was strewn with the d&eacute;bris of the ruined bridge; and
she was unused to such exertion. Snoqualmie saw
her stumble and almost fall. It moved him to a
sudden and unwonted pity, and he sprang forward to
help her. She pushed his hand from her as if it had
been the touch of a serpent, and went on alone. His
eyes flashed: for all this the reckoning should come,
and soon; woe unto her when it came.</p>
<p>The rough rocks bruised her delicately shod feet,
the steep ascent took away her breath. Again and
again she felt as if she must fall; but the bitter scorn
and loathing that Snoqualmie&#8217;s touch had kindled gave
her strength, and at last she completed the ascent.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_256' name='page_256'></a>256</span></div>
<p>Above the falls and close to them, she sat down
upon a rock; a slight, drooping figure, whose dejected
pose told of a broken heart.</p>
<p>Before her, almost at her feet, the pent-up river was
widened to a vast flood. Here and there a half-submerged
pine lifted its crown above it; the surface
was ruffled by the wind, and white-crested waves
were rolling among the green tree-tops. She looked
with indifference upon the scene. She had not
heard that the Bridge had fallen, and was, of course,
ignorant of these new cascades; and they did not
impress her as being strange.</p>
<p>Her whole life was broken up; all the world appeared
shattered by the blow that had fallen on her,
and nothing could startle her now. She felt dimly
that some stupendous catastrophe had taken place;
yet it did not appear unnatural. A strange sense of
unreality possessed her; everything seemed an illusion,
as if she were a shadow in a land of shadows.
The thought came to her that she was dead, and
that her spirit was passing over the dim ghost trail to
the shadow-land. She tried to shake off the fancy,
but all was so vague and dreamlike that she hardly
knew where or what she was; yet over it all brooded
the consciousness of dull, heavy, torturing pain, like
the dumb agony that comes to us in fevered sleep,
burdening our dreams with a black oppressing weight
of horror.</p>
<p>Her hand, hanging listlessly at her side, touched
her flute, which was still suspended from her belt by
the golden chain. She raised it to her lips, but only
a faint inharmonious note came from it. The music
seemed gone from the flute, as hope was gone from
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_257' name='page_257'></a>257</span>
her heart. To her overwrought nerves, it was the
last omen of all. The flute dropped from her fingers;
she covered her face with her hands, and the
hot tears coursed slowly down her cheeks.</p>
<p>Some one spoke to her, not ungently, and she
looked up. One of the canoe-men stood beside her.
He pointed to the canoe, now launched near by.
Snoqualmie was still below, at the foot of the falls,
superintending the removal of the other.</p>
<p>Slowly and wearily she entered the waiting canoe
and resumed her seat. The Indian paddlers took
their places. They told her that the chief Snoqualmie
had bidden them take her on without him. He
would follow in the other canoe. It was a relief to
be free from his presence, if only for a little while;
and the sadness on her face lightened for a moment
when they told her.</p>
<p>A few quick paddle-strokes, and the boat shot out
into the current above the cascades and then glided
forward. No, <i>not</i> forward. The canoe-men, unfamiliar
with the new cataract, had launched their vessel
too close to the falls; and the mighty current was
drawing it back. A cry of horror burst from their
lips as they realized their danger, and their paddles
were dashed into the water with frenzied violence.
The canoe hung quivering through all its slender
length between the desperate strokes that impelled
it forward and the tremendous suction that drew it
down. Had they been closer to the bank, they might
have saved themselves; but they were too far out in
the current. They felt the canoe slipping back in
spite of their frantic efforts, slowly at first, then more
swiftly; and they knew there was no hope.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_258' name='page_258'></a>258</span></div>
<p>The paddles fell from their hands. One boatman
leaped from the canoe with the desperate idea of
swimming ashore, but the current instantly swept him
under and out of sight; the other sat motionless in
his place, awaiting the end with Indian stolidity.</p>
<p>The canoe was swept like a leaf to the verge of the
fall and downward into a gulf of mist and spray. As
it trembled on the edge of the cataract, and its horrors
opened beneath her, Wallulah realized her doom
for the first time; and in the moment she realised it,
it was upon her. There was a quick terror, a dreamlike
glimpse of white plunging waters, a deafening
roar, a sudden terrible shock as the canoe was splintered
on the rocks at the foot of the fall; then all
things were swallowed up in blackness, a blackness
that was death.</p>
<p>Below the falls, strong swimmers, leaping into the
water, brought the dead to land. Beneath a pine-tree
that grew close by the great Columbia trail and
not far from the falls, the bodies were laid. The
daughter of Multnomah lay in rude state upon a fawn-skin;
while at her feet were extended the brawny
forms of the two canoe-men who had died with her,
and who, according to Indian mythology, were to be
her slaves in the Land of the Hereafter. Her face
was very lovely, but its mournfulness remained. Her
flute, broken in the shock that had killed her, was
still attached to her belt. The Indians had placed
her hand at her side, resting upon the flute; and
they noticed in superstitious wonder that the cold
fingers seemed to half close around it, as if they
would clasp it lovingly, even in death. Indian
women knelt beside her, fanning her face with fragrant
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_259' name='page_259'></a>259</span>
boughs of pine. Troop after troop, returning
over the trail to their homes, stopped to hear the
tale, and to gaze at the dead face that was so wonderfully
beautiful yet so sad.</p>
<p>All day long the bands gathered; each stopping,
none passing indifferently by. At length, when evening
came and the shadow of the wood fell long and
cool, the burials began. A shallow grave was scooped
at Wallulah&#8217;s feet for the bodies of the two canoe-men.
Then chiefs&mdash;for they only might bury Multnomah&#8217;s
daughter&mdash;entombed her in a cairn; being
Upper Columbia Indians, they buried her, after the
manner of their people, under a heap of stone. Rocks
and bowlders were built around and over her body,
yet without touching it, until the sad dead face was
shut out from view. And still the stones were piled
above her; higher and higher rose the great rock-heap,
till a mighty cairn marked the last resting-place
of Wallulah. And all the time the women lifted the
death-wail, and Snoqualmie stood looking on with
folded arms and sullen baffled brow. At length the
work was done. The wail ceased; the gathering
broke up, and the sachems and their bands rode away,
Snoqualmie and his troop departing with them.</p>
<p>Only the roar of the cascades broke the silence, as
night fell on the wild forest and the lonely river.
The pine-tree beside the trail swayed its branches in
the wind with a low soft murmur, as if lulling the
sorrow-worn sleeper beneath it into still deeper repose.
And she lay very still in the great cairn,&mdash;the
sweet and beautiful dead,&mdash;with the grim warriors
stretched at her feet, stern guardians of a slumber
never to be broken.</p>

</td></tr></table>
<p>If Multnomah was grieved at his daughter&#8217;s death,
if his heart sunk at the unforeseen and terrible
blow that left his empire without an heir and withered
all his hopes, no one knew it; no eye beheld
his woe. Silent he had ever been, and he was silent
to the last. The grand, strong face only grew grander,
stronger, as the shadows darkened around him; the
unconquerable will only grew the fiercer and the more
unflinching. But ere the moon that shone first on
Wallulah&#8217;s new-made cairn had rounded to the full,
there was that upon him before which even his will
bowed and gave way,&mdash;death, swift and mysterious.
And it came in this wise.</p>
<p>We have told how at the great <i>potlatch</i> he gave
away his all, even to the bear-skins from his couch, reserving
only those cases of Asiatic textures never yet
opened,&mdash;all that now remained of the richly laden
ship of the Orient wrecked long ago upon his coast.
They were opened now. His bed was covered with
the magnificent fabrics; they were thrown carelessly
over the rude walls and seats, half-trailing on the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_261' name='page_261'></a>261</span>
floor; exquisite folds of velvet and damask swept the
leaves and dust,&mdash;so that all men might see how rich
the chief still was, though he had given away so much.
And with his ostentation was mixed a secret pride
and tenderness that his dead wife had indirectly
given him this wealth. The war-chief&#8217;s woman had
brought him these treasures out of the sea; and now
that he had given away his all, even to the bare poles
of his lodge, she filled it with fine things and made
him rich again,&mdash;she who had been sleeping for
years in the death-hut on <i>mimaluse</i> island. Those
treasures, ere the vessel that carried them was
wrecked, had been sent as a present from one oriental
prince to another. Could it be that they had
been purposely impregnated with disease, so that
while the prince that sent them seemed to bestow a
graceful gift, he was in reality taking a treacherous
and terrible revenge? Such things were not infrequent
in Asiatic history; and even the history of
Europe, in the middle ages, tells us of poisoned
masks, of gloves and scarfs charged with disease.</p>
<p>Certain it is that shortly after the cases were
opened, a strange and fatal disease broke out among
Multnomah&#8217;s attendants. The howling of medicine-men
rang all day long in the royal lodge; each day
saw swathed corpses borne out to the funeral pyre
or <i>mimaluse</i> island. And no concoction of herbs,&mdash;however
skilfully compounded with stone mortar
and pestle,&mdash;no incantation of medicine-men or
steaming atmosphere of sweat-house, could stay the
mortality.</p>
<p>At length Multnomah caught the disease. It seemed
strange to the Indians that the war-chief should sicken,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_262' name='page_262'></a>262</span>
that Multnomah should show any of the weaknesses of
common flesh and blood; yet so it was. But while
the body yielded to the inroad of disease, the spirit
that for almost half a century had bent beneath it the
tribes of the Wauna never faltered. He lay for days
upon his couch, his system wasting with the plague,
his veins burning with fever, holding death off only by
might of will. He touched no remedies, for he felt
them to be useless; he refused the incantations of
the medicine-men; alone and in his own strength
the war-chief contended with his last enemy.</p>
<p>All over the Willamette Valley, through camp and
fishery, ran the whisper that Multnomah was dying;
and the hearts of the Indians sunk within them. Beyond
the mountains the whisper passed to the allied
tribes, once more ripe for revolt, and the news rang
among them like a trumpet call; it was of itself a
signal for rebellion. The fall of the magic Bridge, the
death of Wallulah, and the fatal illness of Multnomah
had sealed the doom of the Willamettes. The chiefs
stayed their followers only till they knew that he was
dead. But the grand old war-chief seemed determined
that he would not die. He struggled with
disease; he crushed down his sufferings; he fought
death with the same silent, indomitable tenacity with
which he had overthrown the obstacles of life.</p>
<p>In all his wasting agony he was the war-chief still,
and held his subjects in his grip. To the tribes that
were about to rebel he sent messages, short, abrupt,
but terrible in their threat of vengeance,&mdash;messages
that shook and awed the chiefs and pushed back
invasion. To the last, the great chief overawed the
tribes; the generation that had grown up under the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_263' name='page_263'></a>263</span>
shadow of his tyranny, even when they knew he was
dying, still obeyed him.</p>
<p>At length, one summer evening a few weeks after
the burial of Wallulah, there burst forth from the war-chief&#8217;s
lodge that peculiar wail which was lifted only
for the death of one of the royal blood. No need to
ask who it was, for only <i>one</i> remained of the ancient
line that had so long ruled the Willamettes; and for
him, the last of his race, was the wail lifted. It was
re-echoed by the inmates of the surrounding lodges;
it rang, foreboding, mournful, through the encampment
on Wappatto Island.</p>
<p>Soon, runners were seen departing in every direction
to bear the fatal news throughout the valley.
Twilight fell on them; the stars came out; the moon
rose and sunk; but the runners sped on, from camp
to camp, from village to village. Wherever there was
a cluster of Willamette lodges, by forest, river, or sea,
the tale was told, the wail was lifted. So all that night
the death-wail passed through the valley of the Willamette;
and in the morning the trails were thronged
with bands of Indians journeying for the last time to
the isle of council, to attend the obsequies of their
chief, and consult as to the choice of one to take his
place.</p>
<p>The pestilence that had so ravaged the household
of Multnomah was spread widely now; and every
band as it departed from the camp left death behind
it,&mdash;aye, took death with it; for in each company
were those whose haggard, sickly faces told of disease,
and in more than one were those so weakened that
they lagged behind and fell at last beside the trail to
die.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_264' name='page_264'></a>264</span></div>
<p>The weather was very murky. It was one of the
smoky summers of Oregon, like that of the memorable
year 1849, when the smoke of wide-spread
forest fires hung dense and blinding over Western
Oregon for days, and it seemed to the white settlers
as if they were never to breathe the clear air or see
the sky again. But even that, the historic &#8220;smoky
time&#8221; of the white pioneers, was scarcely equal to the
smoky period of more than a century and a half before.
The forest fires were raging with unusual fury;
Mount Hood was still in course of eruption; and all
the valley was wrapped in settled cloud. Through
the thick atmosphere the tall firs loomed like spectres,
while the far-off roar of flames in the forest and the intermittent
sounds of the volcano came weirdly to the
Indians as they passed on their mournful way. What
wonder that the distant sounds seemed to them wild
voices in the air, prophecying woe; and objects in the
forest, half seen through the smoke, grotesque forms
attending them as they marched! And when the
bands had all gathered on the island, the shuddering
Indians told of dim and shadowy phantoms that had
followed and preceded them all the way; and of
gigantic shapes in the likeness of men that had
loomed through the smoke, warning them back with
outstretched arms. Ominous and unknown cries had
come to them through the gloom; and the spirits of
the dead had seemed to marshal them on their way,
or to oppose their coming,&mdash;they knew not which.</p>
<p>So, all day long, troop after troop crossed the river
to the island, emerging like shadows from the smoke
that seemed to wrap the world,&mdash;each with its sickly
faces, showing the terrible spread of the pestilence;
each helping to swell the great horror that brooded
over all, with its tale of the sick and dead at home,
and the wild things seen on the way. Band after band
the tribes gathered, and when the sun went down the
war-chief&#8217;s obsequies took place.</p>

<i>Multnomah&#8217;s Death-canoe.</i><br />
</p>
</div>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_265' name='page_265'></a>265</span></div>
<p>It was a strange funeral that they gave Multnomah,
yet it was in keeping with the dark, grand life he had
lived.</p>
<p>A large canoe was filled with pitch and with pine-knots,&mdash;the
most inflammable materials an Oregon
forest could furnish. Upon them was heaped all that
was left of the chief&#8217;s riches, all the silks and velvets
that remained of the cargo of the shipwrecked vessel
lost upon the coast long before. And finally, upon
the splendid heap of textures, upon the laces and the
damasks of the East, was laid the dead body of Multnomah,
dressed in buckskin; his moccasins on his
feet, his tomahawk and his pipe by his side, as became
a chief starting on his last journey.</p>
<p>Then as night came on, and the smoky air darkened
into deepest gloom, the canoe was taken out
into the main current of the Columbia, and fire was
set to the dry knots that made up the funeral pyre.
In an instant the contents of the canoe were in a
blaze, and it was set adrift in the current. Down the
river it floated, lighting the night with leaping flames.
On the shore, the assembled tribe watched it in silence,
mute, dejected, as they saw their great chief
borne from them forever. Promontory and dusky
fir, gleaming water and level beach, were brought into
startling relief against the background of night, as the
burning vessel neared them; then sank into shadow as
it passed onward. Overhead, the playing tongues of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_266' name='page_266'></a>266</span>
fire reddened the smoke that hung dense over the
water, and made it assume distorted and fantastic
shapes, which moved and writhed in the wavering
light, and to the Indians seemed spectres of the dead,
hovering over the canoe, reaching out their arms to
receive the soul of Multnomah.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is the dead people come for him,&#8221; the Willamettes
whispered to one another, as they stood upon
the bank, watching the canoe drift farther and farther
from them, with the wild play of light and shadow
over it. Down the river, like some giant torch that
was to light the war-chief along the shadowy ways
of death, passed the burning canoe. Rounding a
wooded point, it blazed a moment brilliantly beside
it, and as it drifted to the farther side, outlined the
intervening trees with fire, till every branch was
clearly relieved against a flaming background; then,
passing slowly on beyond the point, the light waned
gradually, and at last faded quite away.</p>
<p>And not till then was a sound heard among the
silent and impassive throng on the river-bank. But
when the burning canoe had vanished utterly, when
black and starless night fell again on wood and water,
the death-wail burst from the Indians with one impulse
and one voice,&mdash;a people&#8217;s cry for its lost
chief, a great tribe&#8217;s lament for the strength and glory
that had drifted from it, never to return.</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>Among a superstitious race, every fact becomes
mingled more or less with fable; every occurrence,
charged with fantastic meanings. And there sprang
up among the Indians, no one could tell how, a prophecy
that some night when the Willamettes were
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_267' name='page_267'></a>267</span>
in their direst need, a great light would be seen
moving on the waters of the Columbia, and the war-chief
would come back in a canoe of fire to lead
them to victory as of old.</p>
<p>Dire and awful grew their need as the days went
on; swift and sweeping was the end. Long did the
few survivors of his race watch and wait for his return,&mdash;but
never more came back Multnomah to
his own.</p>

<p>And now our tale draws to a close. There remains
but to tell how the last council was held
on Wappatto Island; how Mishlah the Cougar, chief
of the Mollalies, died; and how the prophecy of the
Bridge was fulfilled.</p>
<p>The morning after the obsequies of Multnomah,
the chiefs met in the grove where the great council
of the tribes had been held only a few weeks before.
The leaves, which had been green and glossy then,
were turning yellow and sickly now in the close hot
weather. All Nature seemed full of decay.</p>
<p>The chiefs were grouped before the vacant seat of
Multnomah; and the Willamette tribe, gathered from
canyon and prairie and fishery, looked on, sole spectators
of the proceedings,&mdash;for none of the allies
were present. The ravages of the pestilence had been
terrible. Many warriors were missing from the spectators;
many chiefs were absent from the council.
And there were some present from whom the others
shrunk away, whose hot breath and livid faces showed
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_269' name='page_269'></a>269</span>
that they too were stricken with the plague. There
were emaciated Indians among the audience, whose
gaunt forms and hollow eyes told that they had
dragged themselves to the council-grove to die. The
wailing of the women at the camp, lamenting those just
dead; the howling of the medicine-men in the distance,
performing their incantations over the sick; the
mysterious sounds that came from the burning forest
and the volcano,&mdash;all these were heard. Round
the council the smoke folded thick and dark, veiling
the sun, and shutting out the light of heaven and
the mercy of the Great Spirit.</p>
<p>The chiefs sat long in silence, each waiting for
the other to speak. At length arose a stately warrior
famous among the Willamettes for wisdom and
prudence.</p>
<p>&#8220;We perish,&#8221; said the chief, &#8220;we melt away before
the breath of the pestilence, like snow before the
breath of the warm spring wind. And while we die
of disease in our lodges, war gathers against us beyond
the ranges. Even now the bands of our enemies
may be descending the mountains, and the
tomahawk may smite what the disease has spared.
What is to be done? What say the wise chiefs of
the Willamettes? Multnomah&#8217;s seat is empty: shall
we choose another war-chief?&#8221;</p>
<p>A pale and ghastly chief rose to reply. It was
evident that he was in the last extremity of disease.</p>
<p>&#8220;Shall we choose another war-chief to sit in
Multnomah&#8217;s place? We may; but will he be Multnomah?
The glory of the Willamettes is dead!
Talk no more of war, when our war-strength is gone
from us. The Bridge is fallen, the Great Spirit is
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_270' name='page_270'></a>270</span>
against us. Let those who are to live talk of war.
It is time for us to learn how to die.&#8221;</p>
<p>He sunk flushed and exhausted upon the ground.
Then rose an aged chief, so old that it seemed as if
a century of time had passed over him. His hair
was a dirty gray, his eyes dull and sunken, his
face withered. He supported himself with tremulous
bony hands upon his staff. His voice was feeble, and
seemed like an echo from the long-perished past.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am old, the oldest of all the Willamettes. I
have seen so many winters that no man can count
them. I knew Multnomah&#8217;s father. I went forth to
battle with his father&#8217;s father; and even before that
I knew others, warriors of a forgotten time. Or do
I dream? I know not. The weight of the time
that I have lived is very heavy, and my mind sinks
under it. My form is bowed with the burden of
winters. Warriors, I have seen many councils, many
troubles, but never a trouble like this. Of what use
is your council? Can the words of wise men stay
disease? Can the edge of the tomahawk turn back
sickness? Can you fight against the Great Spirit?
He sent the white man to tell us of our sins and
warn us to be better, and you closed your ears and
would not listen. Nay, you would have slain him
had not the Great Spirit taken him away. These
things would not have come upon us had you listened
to the white <i>shaman</i>. You have offended the Great
Spirit, and he has broken the Bridge and sent disease
upon us; and all that your wisdom may devise can
avail naught to stay his wrath. You can but cover
your faces in silence, and die.&#8221;</p>
<p>For a moment the council was very still. The
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_271' name='page_271'></a>271</span>
memory of the white wanderer, his strong and tender
eloquence, his fearless denunciation, his loving and
passionate appeal, was on them all. <i>Was</i> the Great
Spirit angry with them because they had rejected
him?</p>
<p>&#8220;Who talks of dying?&#8221; said a fierce warrior, starting
to his feet. &#8220;Leave that to women and sick
men! Shall we stay here to perish while life is yet
strong within us? The valley is shadowed with
death; the air is disease; an awful sickness wastes
the people; our enemies rush in upon us. Shall we
then lie down like dogs and wait for death? No.
Let us leave this land; let us take our women and children,
and fly. Let us seek a new home beyond the
Klamath and the Shasta, in the South Land, where
the sun is always warm, and the grass is always green,
and the cold never comes. The spirits are against
us here, and to stay is to perish. Let us seek a new
home, where the spirits are not angry; even as our
fathers in the time that is far back left their old home
in the ice country of the Nootkas and came hither.
I have spoken.&#8221;</p>
<p>His daring words kindled a moment&#8217;s animation in
the despondent audience; then the ceaseless wailing
of the women and the panting of the sick chiefs in
the council filled the silence, and their hearts sank
within them again.</p>
<p>&#8220;My brother is brave,&#8221; said the grave chief who
had opened the council, &#8220;but are his words wise?
Many of our warriors are dead, many are sick, and
Multnomah is gone. The Willamettes are weak; it
is bitter to the lips to say it, but it is true. Our enemies
are strong. All the tribes who were once with
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_272' name='page_272'></a>272</span>
us are against us. The passes are kept by many
warriors; and could we fight our way through them
to another land, the sickness would go with us. Why
fly from the disease here, to die with it in some far-off
land?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We cannot leave our own land,&#8221; said a dreamer,
or medicine-man. &#8220;The Great Spirit gave it to us,
the bones of our fathers are in it. It is <i>our</i> land,&#8221;
he repeated with touching emphasis. &#8220;The Willamette
cannot leave his old home, though the world
is breaking up all around him. The bones of our
people are here. Our brothers lie in the death-huts
on <i>mimaluse</i> island;&mdash;how can we leave them?
Here is the place where we must live; here, if death
comes, must we die!&#8221;</p>
<p>A murmur of assent came from the listeners. It
voiced the decision of the council. With stubborn
Indian fatalism, they would await the end; fighting
the rebels if attacked, and sullenly facing the disease
if unmolested. Now a voice was heard that never
had been heard in accents of despair,&mdash;a voice that
was still fierce and warlike in its resentment of the
course the council was taking. It was the voice of
Mishlah the Cougar, chief of the Mollalies. He, too,
had the plague, and had just reached the grove,
walking with slow and tottering steps, unlike the
Mishlah of other days. But his eyes glittered with all
the old ferocity that had given him the name of
Cougar. Alas, he was but a dying cougar now.</p>
<p>&#8220;Shall we stay here to die?&#8221; thundered the wild
chief, as he stood leaning on his stick, his sunken eyes
sweeping the assembly with a glance of fire. &#8220;Shall
we stand and tremble till the pestilence slays us all
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_273' name='page_273'></a>273</span>
with its arrows, even as a herd of deer, driven into a
deep gulch and surrounded, stand till they are shot
down by the hunters? Shall we stay in our lodges,
and die without lifting a hand? Shall disease burn
out the life of our warriors, when they might fall in
battle? No! Let us slay the women and children,
cross the mountains, and die fighting the rebels! Is
it not better to fall in battle like warriors than to
perish of disease like dogs?&#8221;</p>
<p>The chief looked from face to face, but saw no responsive
flash in the eyes that met his own. The
settled apathy of despair was on every countenance.
Then the medicine-man answered,&mdash;</p>
<p>&#8220;<i>You</i> could never cross the mountains, even if we
did this thing. Your breath is hot with disease; the
mark of death is on your face; the snake of the pestilence
has bitten you. If we went out to battle, you
would fall by the wayside to die. Your time is short.
To-day you die.&#8221;</p>
<p>The grim Mollalie met the speaker&#8217;s glance, and
for a moment wavered. He felt within himself that
the words were true, that the plague had sapped his
life, that his hour was near at hand. Then his hesitation
passed, and he lifted his head with scornful
defiance.</p>
<p>&#8220;So be it! Mishlah accepts his doom. Come, you
that were once the warriors of Multnomah, but whose
hearts are become the hearts of women; come and
learn from a Mollalie how to die!&#8221;</p>
<p>Again his glance swept the circle of chiefs as if
summoning them to follow him,&mdash;then, with weak and
staggering footsteps, he left the grove; and it was as if
the last hope of the Willamettes went with him. The
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_274' name='page_274'></a>274</span>
dense atmosphere of smoke soon shut his form from
view. Silence fell on the council. The hearts of
the Indians were dead within them. Amid their portentous
surroundings,&mdash;the appalling signs of the
wrath of the Great Spirit,&mdash;the fatal apathy which is
the curse of their race crept over them.</p>
<p>Then rose the medicine-man, wild priest of a
wild and debasing superstition, reverenced as one
through whom the dead spoke to the living.</p>
<p>&#8220;Break up your council!&#8221; he said with fearful look
and gesture. &#8220;Councils are for those who expect to
live! and you!&mdash;the dead call you to them. Choose
no chief, for who will be left for him to rule? You
talk of plans for the future. Would you know what
that future will be? I will show you; listen!&#8221; He
flung up his hand as if imposing silence; and, taken
by surprise, they listened eagerly, expecting to hear
some supernatural voice or message prophetic of the
future. On their strained hearing fell only the
labored breathing of the sick chiefs in the council,
the ominous muttering of the far-off volcano, and
loud and shrill above all the desolate cry of the
women wailing their dead.</p>
<p>&#8220;You hear it? That death-wail tells all the future
holds for you. Before yonder red shadow of a sun&#8221;&mdash;pointing
to the sun, which shone dimly through
the smoke&mdash;&#8220;shall set, the bravest of the Mollalies
will be dead. Before the moon wanes to its close, the
Willamette race will have passed away. Think you
Multnomah&#8217;s seat is empty? The Pestilence sits in
Multnomah&#8217;s place, and you will all wither in his hot
and poisonous breath. Break up your council. Go
to your lodges. The sun of the Willamettes is set,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_275' name='page_275'></a>275</span>
and the night is upon us. Our wars are done; our
glory is ended. We are but a tale that old men tell
around the camp-fire, a handful of red dust gathered
from <i>mimaluse</i> island,&mdash;dust that once was man.
Go, you that are as the dead leaves of autumn; go,
whirled into everlasting darkness before the wind
of the wrath of the Great Spirit!&#8221;</p>
<p>He flung out his arms with a wild gesture, as if he
held all their lives and threw them forth like dead
leaves to be scattered upon the winds. Then he
turned away and left the grove. The crowd of warriors
who had been looking on broke up and went
away, and the chiefs began to leave the council, each
muffled in his blanket. The grave and stately sachem
who had opened the council tried for a little while to
stay the fatal breaking up, but in vain. And when he
saw that he could do nothing, he too left the grove,
wrapped in stoical pride, sullenly resigned to whatever
was to come.</p>
<p>And so the last council ended, in hopeless apathy,
in stubborn indecision,&mdash;indecision in everything
save the recognition that a doom was on them against
which it was useless to struggle.</p>
<p>And Mishlah? He returned to his lodge, painted
his face as if he were going to battle, and then went
out to a grove near the place where the war-dances of
the tribe were held. His braves followed him; others
joined them; all watched eagerly, knowing that the
end was close at hand, and wondering how he would
die.</p>
<p>He laid aside his blanket, exposing his stripped
body; and with his eagle plume, in his hair and his
stone tomahawk in his hand, began to dance the war-dance
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_276' name='page_276'></a>276</span>
of his tribe and to chant the song of the battles
he had fought.</p>
<p>At first his utterance was broken and indistinct, his
step feeble. But as he went on his voice rang clearer
and stronger; his step grew quicker and firmer. Half
reciting, half chanting, he continued the wild tale of
blood, dancing faster and faster, haranguing louder and
louder, until he became a flame of barbaric excitement,
until he leaped and whirled in the very madness of
raging passion,&mdash;the Indian war-frenzy.</p>
<p>But it could not last long. His breath came quick
and short; his words grew inarticulate; his eyes
gleamed like coals of fire; his feet faltered in the
dance. With a final effort he brandished and flung
his tomahawk, uttering as he did so a last war-cry,
which thrilled all who heard it as of old when he led
them in battle. The tomahawk sunk to the head in
a neighboring tree, the handle breaking off short with
the violence of the shock; and the chief fell back&mdash;dead.</p>
<p>Thus passed the soul of the fierce Mollalie. For
years afterward, the tomahawk remained where it had
sunk in the tree, sole monument of Mishlah. His
bones lay unburied beneath, wasted by wind and rain,
till there was left only a narrow strip of red earth, with
the grass springing rankly around it, to show where
the body had been. And the few survivors of the
tribe who lingered in the valley were wont to point
to the tomahawk imbedded in the tree, and tell the
tale of the warrior and how he died.</p>
<p>Why dwell longer on scenes so terrible? Besides,
there is but little more to tell. The faithless allies
made a raid on the valley; but the shrouding atmosphere
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_277' name='page_277'></a>277</span>
of smoke and the frightful rumors they heard
of the great plague appalled them, and they retreated.
The pestilence protected the Willamettes. The Black
Death that the medicine-men saw sitting in Multnomah&#8217;s
place turned back the tide of invasion better
than the war-chief himself could have done.</p>
<p>Through the hot months of summer the mortality
continued. The valley was swept as with the besom
of destruction, and the drama of a people&#8217;s death was
enacted with a thousand variations of horror. When
spring came, the invaders entered the valley once
more. They found it deserted, with the exception
of a few wretched bands, sole survivors of a mighty
race. They rode through villages where the decaying
mats hung in tatters from the half-bare skeleton-like
wigwam poles, where the ashes had been cold for
months at the camp-fires; they rode by fisheries
where spear and net were rotting beside the canoe
upon the beach. And the dead&mdash;the dead lay everywhere:
in the lodges, beside the fisheries, along the
trail where they had been stricken down while trying
to escape,&mdash;everywhere were the ghastly and
repulsive forms.</p>
<p>The spirit of the few survivors was broken, and
they made little resistance to the invaders. Mongrel
bands from the interior and the coast settled in the
valley after the lapse of years; and, mixing with the
surviving Willamettes, produced the degenerate race
our own pioneers found there at their coming. These
hybrids were, within the memory of the white man,
overrun and conquered by the Yakimas, who subjugated
all the Indians upon Wappatto Island and
around the mouth of the Willamette in the early
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_278' name='page_278'></a>278</span>
part of the present century. Later on, the Yakimas
were driven back by the whites; so that there have
been three conquests of the lower Willamette Valley
since the fall of the ancient race,&mdash;two Indian
conquests before the white.</p>
<p>The once musical language of the Willamettes has
degenerated into the uncouth Chinook, and the blood
of the ancient race flows mixed and debased in the
veins of abject and squalid descendants; but the
story of the mighty bridge that once spanned the
Columbia at the Cascades is still told by the Oregon
Indians. Mingled with much of fable, overlaid with
myth and superstition, it is nevertheless one of the
historic legends of the Columbia, and as such will
never be forgotten.</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>One word more of Cecil Gray, and our tale is done.</p>
<p>The Shoshone renegade, who resolved at Cecil&#8217;s
death to become a Christian, found his way with a
few followers to the Flat-Heads, and settled among
that tribe. He told them of what he had learned
from Cecil,&mdash;of the Way of Peace; and the wise
men of the tribe pondered his sayings in their hearts.
The Shoshone lived and died among them; but from
generation to generation the tradition of the white
man&#8217;s God was handed down, till in 1832 four Flat-Heads
were sent by the tribe to St. Louis, to ask that
teachers be given them to tell them about God.</p>
<p>Every student of history knows how that appeal
stirred the heart of the East, and caused the sending
out of the first missionaries to Oregon; and from the
movement then inaugurated have since sprung all the
missions to the Indians of the West.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_279' name='page_279'></a>279</span></div>
<p>Thus he who gave his life for the Indians, and died
seemingly in vain, sowed seed that sprung up and
bore a harvest long after his death. And to-day, two
centuries since his body was laid in the lonely grave
on Wappatto Island, thousands of Indians are the
better for his having lived. No true, noble life can be
said to have been lived in vain. Defeated and beaten
though it may seem to have been, there has gone
out from it an influence for the better that has helped
in some degree to lighten the great heartache and
bitterness of the world. Truth, goodness, and self-sacrifice
are never beaten,&mdash;no, not by death itself.
The example and the influence of such things is
deathless, and lives after the individual is gone,
flowing on forever in the broad life of humanity.</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>I write these last lines on Sauvie&#8217;s Island&mdash;the
Wappatto of the Indians,&mdash;sitting upon the bank of
the river, beneath the gnarled and ancient cottonwood
that still marks the spot where the old Columbia
trail led up from the water to the interior of the island.
Stately and beautiful are the far snow-peaks and the
sweeping forests. The woods are rich in the colors
of an Oregon autumn. The white wappatto blooms
along the marshes, its roots ungathered, the dusky
hands that once reaped the harvest long crumbled
into dust. Blue and majestic in the sunlight flows
the Columbia, river of many names,&mdash;the Wauna
and Wemath of the Indians, the St. Roque of the
Spaniards, the Oregon of poetry,&mdash;always vast and
grand, always flowing placidly to the sea. Steamboats
of the present; batteaux of the fur traders;
ships, Grey&#8217;s and Vancouver&#8217;s, of discovery; Indian
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_280' name='page_280'></a>280</span>
canoes of the old unknown time,&mdash;the stately river
has seen them all come and go, and yet holds its
way past forest and promontory, still beautiful and unchanging.
Generation after generation, daring hunter,
ardent discoverer, silent Indian,&mdash;all the shadowy
peoples of the past have sailed its waters as we sail
them, have lived perplexed and haunted by mystery
as we live, have gone out into the Great Darkness
with hearts full of wistful doubt and questioning, as we
go; and still the river holds its course, bright, beautiful,
inscrutable. It stays; <i>we go</i>. Is there anything
<i>beyond</i> the darkness into which generation follows
generation and race follows race? Surely there is an
after-life, where light and peace shall come to all
who, however defeated, have tried to be true and
loyal; where the burden shall be lifted and the heartache
shall cease; where all the love and hope that
slipped away from us here shall be given back to
us again, and given back forever.</p>
